Monad Solutions (Europe and Asia-Pacific) has been acquired by Legalese, a Singapore-based LegalTech specialist building next-generation rules and decisioning technology. Founded on the principle that regulatory and policy logic should be AI-generated, human-readable, and machine-executable, Legalese combines modern large language models with a robust rules execution engine to bridge the gap between law, policy, and operational systems. Monad's founder Michael Fairweather, joins Legalese as Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for Sales and Delivery, bringing more than a decade of experience delivering complex decision automation and compliance systems for public and private sector clients globally. Overall, the transaction represents a natural convergence of proven delivery capability and a product-led vision focused on clarity, maintainability, and scale.

Exciting times ahead for 2026!
