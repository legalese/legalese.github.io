Yesterday, Monad Solutions (EMEA and APAC) was acquired by Legalese.com, a Singapore-based LegalTech company. As part of this change, I have joined Legalese as Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for Sales and Delivery.

I continue to have enormous respect for OIA and all the people that build, maintain and sell the platform, but after we successfully delivered our 2 long term client projects in 2025, we ran out of OIA work, so needed to make a change. One of the challenges that the Oracle sales team in Singapore has been having is the absence of an on-premise deployment option, which the Singapore government still very much favours, even if it goes against modern trends.

All the best for 2026!
Michael
