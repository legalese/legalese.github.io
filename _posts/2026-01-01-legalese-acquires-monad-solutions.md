Yesterday, Monad Solutions (EMEA and APAC) was acquired by Legalese.com, a Singapore-based LegalTech company. As part of this change, I have joined Legalese as Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for Sales and Delivery.

I continue to have enormous respect for OIA and all the people that build, maintain and sell the platform, but after we successfully delivered our 2 long term client projects in 2025, we ran out of OIA work, so needed to make a change. One of the challenges that the Oracle sales team in Singapore has been having is the absence of an on-premise deployment option, which the Singapore government still very much favours, even if it goes against modern trends.

At Legalese, we are very open to implementing OIA if the opportunity arises, but since Legalese has its own platform (based on an open source language L4, developed by the Singapore Management University under the direction of Meng Weng Wong, the founder of Legalese), I completely understand if the Oracle sales team prefers not to bring us into opportunities. What I can say for sure is that if we are introduced as an implementation partner of Oracle, then we would focus exclusively on positioning OIA and not L4 or any other non-Oracle technology.

Either way, I hope we can stay in touch.

Tomorrow, I'll also share this news with the handful of Oracle sales and presales people that I have been working with in Singapore and the Philippines.

All the best for 2026!
Michael
