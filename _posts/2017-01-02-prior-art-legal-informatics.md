> "There is this tremendous body of knowledge in the world of academia where extraordinary numbers of incredibly thoughtful people have taken the time to examine on a really profound level the way we live our lives and who we are and what we've been. That brilliant learning sometimes gets trapped in academia and never sees the light of day."
> — Malcolm Gladwell

## (at least) 70 years of legal informatics

*The legal informatics industry is older than most web developers today.*

An (incomplete) history in rough chronology—[let us know](mailto:support@legalese.com?subject=Suggested%20listings%20for%20the%20Legalese%20website) if we missed something.

## Formalising Contracts

- The urge to formalize goes back at least as far as [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_of_human_thought), that's the early 18th century
- Lee Loevinger's [Jurimetrics -- The Next Step Forward](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29762866?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), 1948: *"apparently, it has never occurred to the professional disciples of the subject that the trouble with law is not the public but the lawyers, that what is needed is not publicity but progress"*

## Formalising Regulations

As the richly interpretable saying goes, "[Law is Code](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/lawiscode/)" and, conversely, [Code is Law](http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/01/code-is-law-html) (Lessig, 2000). Legislative and regulatory constraints may be modeled using a declarative language.

## Formal Verification of Smart Contracts

Formal methods and languages like [Agda](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2841316), [Idris](http://cufp.org/2014/t5-edwin-brady-idris-practical-software-verification-with-Dependent-types.html), [Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/), and [CoQ](https://coq.inria.fr/), not to mention specification languages like [Z](http://formalmethods.wikia.com/wiki/Z_notation), hold much promise. On the spectrum of software reliability, smart contracts ought to live near mission-critical or life-critical software – cryptosystems, human-crewed spacecraft, hospital equipment. Today, they're closer to enterprise web-apps.

See [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) on why formal verification is important.
