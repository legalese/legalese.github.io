Legalese, a LegalTech startup in Singapore, has been awarded a grant from String Labs. The grant of US$8,888 will fund development of a new programming language for contracts called "L4", which aims to make it possible for contracts to be formally verified as correct, consistent and complete – a goal with fresh urgency for the blockchain economy.

## Why the urgency?

In June, $100M worth of the Ether cryptocurrency was put at risk when a security flaw in an experimental smart contract was discovered and exploited by an anonymous attacker. "As witnessed with the DAO hack incident and the ongoing hard-fork debate, the consequences of flawed financial smart contracts are extremely costly," says Tom Ding, CEO & co-founder of String Labs. "We hope that new technologies like L4 will provide a firm foundation for secure smart contracts."

## Deep tech for contracts

"This is deep tech. L4 will be to contracts what SQL is to databases," said Wong Meng Weng, a co-founder of Legalese and computer scientist. "Today's approaches to writing contracts – whether English contracts written in Word, or Ethereum contracts in Solidity – are dangerously low-level, and a breeding ground for bugs. In the software world, functional and logical programmers are showing the rest of us how to detect bugs at compile time."

"We're building on decades of academic research," said Vikram Verma, R&D engineer at Legalese. "Research that has shown it is possible to model systems of obligations in ways amenable to formal reasoning, that there exist techniques to verify that their behaviour insubvertibly satisfies the intentions held by their authors. We hope to stand on the shoulders of giants."

## Move fast and break things?

"For better or worse, most blockchain developers acquired habits from web development," said Virgil Griffith, a Caltech Ph.D. and Legalese evangelist. "`Move fast and break things' – Facebook's famous motto. But web pages are cheap to update, compared to contracts. Smart contracts are immutable by design. That's kind of the whole point! Even spacecraft can be upgraded after launch; that means Blockchain coders might have to do even better than NASA."

"You want to be confident that your programs are well-behaved prior to runtime," elaborated Verma.

"Because finding bugs at runtime – that's called litigation," Wong interjected smugly.

## Tools for legal

"Software developers have built arsenals of tools and techniques to do their jobs better," Wong explained. "We've got version control, compilers, continuous integration, automated testing, fuzzing, static analysis. We've even got math on our side: the lambda calculus, the pi-calculus, and the mu-calculus. What have lawyers got?"

"Track changes," admitted Alexis Chun, self-described recovering lawyer and co-founder at Legalese. "Lawyers' toolkits haven't really changed since the 1980s. Corporations and banks are already experimenting with the blockchain to bypass the existing financial system -- how much longer will clients be willing to pay $500/hour for associates to customise a template? Lawyers justify their price tag by talking about the years they spent in law school and in practice. Well, London black-cab drivers talk about the years they spent learning the Knowledge. Computational law is like sat-nav for legal. Soon, self-driving cars will arrive, and the idea of a human lawyer will seem even more quaint."

## Compiling to English

How will L4 relate to traditional law? "We will compile to English," promised Wong. "Think about the template solutions out there today. Semantics are the next step: if computer understands the content of a contract, it can say, `this clause contracts that.' With semantics, you program in L4, then compile into English. Or any other natural language. In future, contracts will be compiled by computer, not written by hand by junior lawyers. We're part of a worldwide movement to marry legal code and computer code, with real-world, commercial consequences. It's a movement that intrigues some of the biggest banks in the world."

## Why String Labs chose Legalese

"Our grant program received dozens of fascinating ideas. As technologists and programmers, we resonated with Legalese's ambitions. We agreed that it just felt right, and we want to see L4 succeed," said Dominic Williams, co-founder at String Labs. "It could end up being a foundational element of the new world we're all building together."

## About Legalese

Legalese.com is pioneering computational law. Legalese's technology makes it possible to write legal apps the way programmers write software apps. A key element is L4, an opensource programming language for contracts. With that foundation, Legalese plans to develop a suite of SaaS applications aimed at tech-savvy end-users. The flagship app, which helps entrepreneurs configure and produce all the paperwork for an angel or seed round, has already processed over $1 million in deal volume to date. Legalese was spun out of JFDI.Asia, Southeast Asia's first startup accelerator, in 2015, and is currently based in Singapore. Its mascot is an octopus.
