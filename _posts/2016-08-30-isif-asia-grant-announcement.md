Legalese, an opensource startup aiming to replace contract-drafting lawyers with contract-drafting software, has been awarded the Technical Innovation Grant from ISIF.Asia. Managed by the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC), ISIF.Asia (or, the Information Society Innovation Fund) aims to stimulate creative solutions to the development needs of ICT (information and communication technologies) in the Asia-Pacific region. This is the first time a Singaporean startup has been awarded an ISIF.Asia grant. The grant of AUD$30,000 will fund the development of Legalese's first web application that makes it possible for SMEs and startups entrepreneurs to structure, generate, and execute all the fundraising paperwork they need to effect a deal.

## The "unlawyered" and "underlawyered"

Why fundraising paperwork in Southeast Asia? "Emerging middle-class entrepreneurs in South & Southeast Asia who have found interested investors still suffer friction in actually closing the deal because lawyers are expensive, because templates for investment agreements are primarily in English, and because web-based solutions today are mainly only available for American jurisdictions," explains Wong Meng Weng, a computer scientist and co-founder of Legalese.

"In the startup financing and FinTech world, a great deal is being said about improving access to finance for the unbanked and underbanked. But less attention seems to be given to contracts and corporate forms needed by the "unlawyered" and "underlawyered" entrepreneurs and small business owners in emerging economies. This is a systemic barrier to economic advancement" added Ong Chiah Li, Legalese's co-founder and domain expert in venture capital and startup fundraising.

"So our answer to the access-to-legal problem is not more lawyers; it's free software that rests on deep tech. It's computational legal," quips Alexis Chun, self-described recovering lawyer and also co-founder of Legalese.

## Building on L4

Legalese's underlying technology is a new programming language for contracts and legal documentation called "L4". Amongst other things, L4 will encapsulate complex interactions between documents needed to effect a deal, provide access to multilingual libraries of templates, and demonstrate the implications of proposed actions or possible scenarios. Thereby, enabling access-to-legal in nascent South and Southeast Asian entrepreneurs, who are currently priced out of legal services and forced to DIY.

"Our insight is that there are deep symmetries between what programmers do when they write software, and what lawyers do when they draft contracts. But because lawyers are programming in natural languages like English, they are hobbled by the lack of formalisms. Bugs breed easily, and may lie in wait for years before emerging. When bugs do appear "at runtime", the way to "handle exceptions" is often litigation. To a lawyer, this is just how the world works; to a programmer, it is a symptom of bad engineering caused by insufficient tooling. It is something to be fixed," says Vikram Verma, R&D engineer at Legalese.

## The opensource approach

"We envision that the social practices common to software development will soon begin to influence the delivery of law. Instead of sending Word documents back and forth with "track changes", the community may one day send pull requests on Github. Instead of relying on an experienced lawyer for advice, an end-user may consult the legal equivalent of StackExchange to hear opinions from a community of peers. Citizens may get more involved in democratic processes, contributing to the legislative process not just by protesting, but by demonstrating an undesirable edge case through a software-supported scenario visualisation, and offering a proposed patch," says Virgil Griffith, chief evangelist at Legalese, and also the CalTech Ph.D of Tor2Web and WikiScanner fame.

"This social element of the innovation is where opensource shines. Today, lawyers don't talk to one another the way programmers do. The very idea of opensource seems very strange to lawyers who guard their templates jealously. But openness encourages responsiveness, result-verification, and collaboration that can scale a project beyond what a close-door approach can. Both our language and the documents written in the language will be opensource and Creative Commons; we want to enable a flourishing ecosystem of open content which ultimately benefits end-users," says Colin Charles, Legalese's opensource advisor who was an early employee at MySQL.

## The instagrammification of law

How will such deep-tech be accessible to these emerging middle-class, and often first-time entrepreneurs? "We see that as a design and interface problem. Our application will unbundle the conventional package of a lawyer (e.g. education, contract drafting, process management) and rebundle that into a user-friendly, outcome-oriented interface that is a little like the instagrammification of law", says Chun.

## Why ISIF.Asia chose Legalese

"We reviewed over 300 applications before selecting the final 10 initiatives. As technologists invested in the effective development of the information society, we resonated with Legalese's ambitions. We are excited to see how Legalese will empower and energise the startup community in emerging markets," says Sylvia Cadena, Partnerships Specialist at APNIC (the body managing ISIF.Asia). "We are proud to be supporting Legalese's aim of democratising access-to-legal."

## About Legalese

Legalese.com is pioneering computational law. Legalese's technology makes it possible to write legal apps the way programmers write software apps. A key element is L4, an opensource programming language for contracts. With that foundation, Legalese plans to develop a suite of SaaS applications aimed at tech-savvy end-users. The flagship app, which helps entrepreneurs configure and produce all the paperwork for an angel or seed round, has already processed over $1 million in deal volume to date. Legalese was spun out of JFDI.Asia, Southeast Asia's first startup accelerator, in 2015, and is currently based in Singapore.

## About ISIF.Asia

The Information Society Innovation Fund (ISIF Asia) is a grants and awards program aimed at stimulating creative solutions to ICT development needs in the Asia Pacific region, placing particular emphasis on the role of the Internet in social and economic development in the region, towards the effective development of the Information Society throughout.

## About the Technical Innovation Grant

[http://isif.asia/Grants_TechnicalInnovation](http://isif.asia/Grants_TechnicalInnovation)

Through the Technical Innovation Grants, ISIF Asia will allocate 2 grants of 30,000 AUD each focusing on new initiatives, testing of new ideas, proof of concept or prototypes. Innovation and a development focus should be an integral part of the project, focusing on areas such as access provision, electricity supply, devices, IoT, IPv6 and privacy.

There is a strong emphasis about documentation of impact and knowledge sharing through papers, videos, and other communication materials. Successful applicants will have to include a clear communication strategy for the dissemination of project outcomes.

Organizations and companies working on Internet development from the public and/or private sector are encouraged to apply.
