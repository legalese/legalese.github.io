# Descriptive Text

Legalese is pioneering computational law. Legalese's L4 programming language makes it possible to draft legal documents the way programmers develop software. L4 is a declarative, functional programming language, operationalizing deontic‐temporal modal logic to efficiently and verifiably express obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. Legalese is also developing a suite of SaaS application aimed at tech-savvy DIY end-users: its flagship app helps entrepreneurs configure and produce all the paperwork for an angel or seed round. The beta has processed over $1 million in deal volume in the last year. With open source principles at its core, Legalese has code on Github (https://github.com/legalese). The company was spun out of JFDI.Asia, Southeast Asia's first startup accelerator. Its mascot is a pangolin.

## About the Logo

"LEGALESE.COM" is set in [Alegreya](http://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro) Bold (available on Google Fonts) all caps with some letterspacing.

The logo is based on a [section sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign) in Alegreya Bold rotated 90º. Our version of the logo is a custom design by Huerta but in a pinch you may just use the standard glyph from the font.


# Sassy Quote from Techcrunch

The original post is at https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/10/documents-just-want-to-be-free/

To be clear, the article was written before Legalese was launched, and the source of the quote was not talking about Legalese in particular – they were talking about LegalTech startups generally. But we are a LegalTech startup and fit the description to a T.
