  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">Whereas:</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(A) The Company was incorporated in Singapore on 1 March 2011 and has, at the date hereof, an issued and paid-up share capital of S$5,998,482.80 comprising 120,000,000 Ordinary Shares (as defined below) and 204,788,624 Series A RCPS (as defined below).</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(B) On 15 July 2013 the Investor, the Company and the Founders entered into a subscription and shareholder’s agreement (the “Series A SSHA”) to which the Series A Shareholders later became parties pursuant to deeds of ratification and accession.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(C) The Investor and the New Series B Investors have agreed to invest in the Company by subscribing for new Series B CPS (as defined below) in the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(D) The Company has also entered into the Series B Convertible Loan Agreements (as defined below).</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(E)  To regulate the relationship of the Shareholders (as defined below) inter se as shareholders of the Company following the subscription of the Series B CPS and the conversion of the Series B Convertible Loan Agreements, and to regulate the conduct of the business and affairs of the</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">Company, in the spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation, the Parties have agreed to amend and restate the Series A SSHA on the terms and conditions hereinafter set out.</p>

Following the issuance of the Series B CPS pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Series B Convertible Loan Agreements the Company will have in excess of 50 shareholders. As the Companies Act does not permit a private company limited by shares to have more than 50 shareholders, the Company must convert to a public company in order to issue the Series B CPS.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(G) In connection with the entry into this Agreement, certain Shareholders (including parties who will become shareholders pursuant to the conversion of their Series B Convertible Loan Agreements) have requested to re-organize their holdings in the Company after Completion in respect of 43,702,652 Shares in aggregate, representing 7.19% of the Shares.

  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(vi) Subject to Article 4A(2)(a)(E), the Series A Preference Dividend in respect of the Series A RCPS to be redeemed by the Company pursuant to this Article 4A(2)(c) shall cease to accrue on and with effect from the Series A Redemption Date.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(vii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 4A(2)(c), the Company shall upon receipt of the Series A Redemption Notice be entitled to elect to redeem the Series A RCPS over a three (3)-year period at the rate of one-third (1/3) of the Series A Redemption Value commencing from the first anniversary date of the Company’s receipt of the Series A Redemption Notice from the redeeming Series A RCPS Shareholder in accordance with this Article 4A(2)(c) and in the event that the Company so elects, the provisions in Articles 4A(2)(c)(iii) to (vi) with respect to redemption of the relevant Series A RCPS on the Series A Redemption Date shall mutatis mutandis apply to the redemption of one-third (1/3) of the relevant Series A RCPS on each of the first three (3) anniversaries after the date of receipt of the Series A Redemption Notice by the Company.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(d) DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OR PARTIAL PAYMENT</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">If by reason of any provision of the Act, the Company is unable to make payment of any amount due in respect of the Series A RCPS (whether in respect of the Series A Preference Dividend, the Series A Redemption Value or otherwise) and/or redeem any of the relevant Series A RCPS following the receipt of a Series A Redemption Notice from a Series A RCPS Shareholder, then the Company shall from time to time (subject to the maximum amount and extent permitted by law, and on the earliest date on which such payments or redemption may lawfully be made) make payments on account of the amount so owing on a pro rata basis until such amount has been paid in full, and in the case of a redemption, any unredeemed Series A RCPS will be carried forward and redeemed as soon as the Company is legally able to do so.</p>

  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">Each Series A RCPS Shareholder:</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(i) shall be entitled to receive copies of  the  reports  and  accounts  (including the balance sheet and profit and loss account) and notices of general meetings, being the same as those which the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive;</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(ii)  shall be entitled to attend (in person or by proxy or attorney or in the case of a corporation, by a duly authorised representative) any general meeting of the Company and to be counted for the purposes of a quorum at such general meeting and to vote at any general meeting; and</p>

  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">date forty-eight (48) hours preceding the date of such general meeting or the class meeting of the Series A RCPS Shareholders, as the case may be.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">A Series A RCPS Shareholder may appoint a proxy to attend and vote at the same general meeting or the class meeting of the Series A RCPS Shareholders. A proxy need not be a member.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">The provisions of these Articles relating to votes of members shall (subject to and except to the extent inconsistent with this Article 4A) apply mutatis mutandis to votes of the Series A RCPS Shareholders at any general meeting or the class meeting of Series A RCPS Shareholders, as the case may be.</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">(f) VOLUNTARY CONVERSION</p>
  <p comment="MAY NEED FIXING">Each Series A RCPS Shareholder shall have the Series A Conversion Right in relation to his Series A RCPS and shall be entitled to exercise the Series A Conversion Right in respect of all or any of his Series A RCPS to convert such Series A RCPS into ordinary shares credited as fully paid at the Series A Conversion Ratio upon and subject to the following terms:</p>
