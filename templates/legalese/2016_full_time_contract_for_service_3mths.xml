<!--Original drafter's disclaimer
TL;DR IANAL
  Whilst I am an advocate and solicitor of the supreme court of Singapore (a.k.a being called to the bar) but I am not a lawyer with a current practising cert / license.  This is because (in no particular order), I am no longer attached to a law firm, don't want to set up my own law firm, and think it's about time we replace contract drafting lawyers with contract drafting software.

  But this contract is pre-DSL / smart software. This means that I am still, as lawyers do, using computers to help with the manual work but not with the thinking -  so there will be mistakes, oversight, unclear language (whether intended or not). It kinda sucks. But we are working on it, and hopefully soon, someone will get to draft a level-up version of this in L4 (or whatever we end up calling our DSL).-->

<!--Who this contract is for: Contractor (i.e. not an employee)
(and by contractor, we mean someone who is not an employee. As much as we don't want to restrict people from working for other people, studying, doing whatever the fuck they want during their engagement with us, we also don't want to / have the resources to manages the admin and overheads resulting from any employment legislation or rules)-->

<!-- Other features of this contract:
    - fixed term, with option for extension (gives us flexibility to renew, pull out, vary etc)
    - full-time basis, but non-exclusive (full-time in the sense that we want to cover robust commitment and responsibilities; does not mean 9-5 hours)
    - emphasis on independence, self-direction, control on the part of the contractor (i.e. items that make it clear that it is not an employment agreement) -->

<!-- For greater flexibility, the output date should be different from the Effective Date.
  Why?
    Mainly because Legalese gets the parties to execute it via Echosign - this means that parties and Legalese don't actually know at the outset the exact date of when the contract is to take effect. Like overeating at work lunches, it's not wrong per se; it just has the potential to get rather hairy, confusing, and/or complicating.

    Setting the Output Date as distinct from the Effective Date also allows for backdating - a rather common but unrecommended practice. IANAL (with a current practising certificate/license). As far as I am aware, under SG law, backdating is not illegal per se (unless done with the intention to defraud). It just makes managing the document-dependencies and timelines hairier for humans; no problem for computers though. -->
