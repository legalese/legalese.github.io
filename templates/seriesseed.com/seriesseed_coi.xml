<numbered_3_firstbold>General. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock may cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.  Fractional votes shall not be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred stock held by each holder could be converted) will be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).  Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of these Articles, holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision of these Articles, to notice of any stockholder meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.</numbered_3_firstbold>

<b_left_sidehead xname="conversion">Conversion</b_left_sidehead>

<para_1>The holders of the Series Seed Preferred Stock have the following conversion rights (the <b><i>“Conversion Rights”</i></b>):</para_1>

<numbered_3_firstbold>Right to Convert.</numbered_3_firstbold>

<numbered_4_firstbold xname="conversionratio">Conversion Ratio. Each share of Series Seed Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the series of Series Seed Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for that series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect at the time of conversion.  The <b><i>"Conversion Price"</i></b> for each series of Series Seed Preferred Stock means the Original Issue Price for such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock, which initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, is subject to adjustment as provided in these Articles.</numbered_4_firstbold>

<numbered_4_firstbold>Termination of Conversion Rights.  Subject to Section <xref to="conversionnotice" /> in the case of a Contingency Event herein, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights will terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the first payment of any funds and assets distributable on such event to the holders of Series Seed Preferred Stock.</numbered_4_firstbold>

<numbered_3_firstbold xname="fractional">Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of the Series Seed Preferred Stock.  In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board.  Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.</numbered_3_firstbold>

<numbered_3_firstbold>Mechanics of Conversion.</numbered_3_firstbold>

<numbered_4_firstbold xname="conversionnotice">Notice of Conversion. To voluntarily convert shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, a holder of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Series Seed Preferred Stock (or at the office of the secretary of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that the holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Series Seed Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which the conversion is contingent (a <b><i>“Contingency Event”</i></b>).</numbered_4_firstbold>

<para_2>The conversion notice must state the holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.
The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of the certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or, if later, the date on which all Contingency Events have occurred) will be the time of conversion (the <b><i>“Conversion Time”</i></b>), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such time.
The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and deliver to the holder, or to the holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion in accordance with the provisions of these Articles and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section <xref to="fractional" /> in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock converted.</para_2>

    <numbered_4_firstbold>Effect of Conversion. All shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as provided in these Articles shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares will immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section <xref to="fractional" />, and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.  Any shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.</numbered_4_firstbold>
    <numbered_4_firstbold>No Further Adjustment. Upon any conversion of shares of Pre-ferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.</numbered_4_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold xname="stocksplits">Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation (such date referred to herein as the <b><i>“Original Issue Date”</i></b> for such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock) effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of that series will be increased in proportion to the increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination will be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Any adjustment under this Section <xref to="stocksplits" /> becomes effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold xname="adjustmentcertain">Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price for such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the event will be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event a a record date has been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_4_para>the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of the issuance or the close of business on the record date, and</numbered_4_para>
    <numbered_4_para>the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the time of such issuance or the close of business on the record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.</numbered_4_para>
    <para_1>Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date has have been fixed and the dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and there-after such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section <xref to="adjustmentcertain" /> as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of the event.</para_1>
    <numbered_3_firstbold xname="adjustmentothers">Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each such event the Corporation shall make, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution to the holders of the series of Series Seed Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the amount of securities as the holders would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold xname="adjustmentmisc">Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections <xref to="stocksplits" />, <xref to="adjustmentcertain" />, <xref to="adjustmentothers" /> or <xref to="adjustmentmerger" /> or by Section <xref to="liquidation" /> regarding a Deemed Liquidation Event), then in any such event each holder of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock may thereafter convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalisation, reclassification or change.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold>Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation. Subject to the provisions of Section <xref to="liquidation" />, if any consolidation or merger occurs involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections <xref to="adjustmentcertain" />, <xref to="adjustmentothers" /> or <xref to="adjustmentmisc" />), then, following any such consolidation or merger, the Corporation shall provide that each share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to the event, into the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the transaction; and, in such case, the Corporation shall make appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) in the application of the provisions in this Section <xref to="conversion" /> with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section <xref to="conversion" />(including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold>Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section <xref to="conversion" />, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of these Articles and furnish to each holder of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth the adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other property into which such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.  The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Series Seed Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Price of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash, or property which then would be received upon the conversion of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold xname="mandatory">Mandatory Conversion. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an prospectus under the Securities and Futures Act or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the Requisite Holders at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent,the <b><i>“Mandatory Conversion Time”</i></b>), (i) all outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock, at the applicable ratio described in Section <xref to="conversionratio" /> as the same may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Section <xref to="conversion" /> and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_3_firstbold xname="procedural">Procedural Requirements. The Corporation shall notify in writing all holders of record of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock pursuant to Section <xref to="mandatory" />.  Unless otherwise provided in these Articles, the notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time.  Upon receipt of the notice, each holder of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock shall surrender such holder’s certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section <xref to="conversion" />.  If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.  All rights with respect to the Series Seed Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section <xref to="mandatory" />, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section <xref to="procedural" />.  As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Series Seed Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to such holder’s nominee(s), a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Section <xref to="fractional" />in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock converted.  Such converted Series Seed Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (and the applicable series thereof) accordingly.</numbered_3_firstbold>
    <numbered_2_firstbold>Dividends. The Corporation shall declare all dividends pro rata on the Common Stock and the Series Seed Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of as-converted shares of Common Stock held by such holders.  For this purpose each holder of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock will be treated as holding the greatest whole number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of all shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section <xref to="conversion" />.</numbered_2_firstbold>
    <numbered_2_firstbold>Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Any shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries will be automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.
