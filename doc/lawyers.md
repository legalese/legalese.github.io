# Hello those who have received legal training


We have numerous things you'd probably enjoy reading.

Before you do anything else:

* If you're into the Twitter, you can follow us at [@legalese](http://twitter.com/legalese).
* If you're already a little technical, you may enjoy this discussion of [why a programming language](https://medium.com/@Legalese/code-is-law-is-code-4492c864f33f) instead of plain JSON.
