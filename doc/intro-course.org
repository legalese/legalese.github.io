#+TITLE: An Introductory Course in Computable Contracts

* Introduction

This course was designed in mid-2017 to survey the field of computational contracts, which is just now emerging from academia toward industrial practice.

** Audiences

The course is intended for two audiences.

One, the non-technical reader with some experience with the legal profession, considering a career in legal engineering, unafraid to dip a toe into computer science. A law student seeking alternatives to the conventional law-firm future: junior associate, senior associate, partner, corpse.

Two, the technical reader, perhaps a self-taught or classically educated programmer, who is interested in approaching contract law as a special case of applied computer science. Perhaps a contrarian uninterested in the current fads of big-data deep learning statistical A.I., web / mobile app development, or instant cryptocurrency riches.

This is not a bloodless sport. You might have parents or friends who are lawyers. As a computer geek at heart, you might feel a certain competitive urge to show that your magic is as strong as theirs. Nurture this flame. It is an authentic motivation.

There is a third type of audience. Maybe you grew up coding, but now find yourself working in law. Perhaps you are entertaining thoughts about defecting to the other camp where your first love still waits. We can neither confirm nor deny that any such attempts will succeed. Say nothing, but blink twice if you understand.

** By the end of this course

You will gain passing acquaintance with the foundational technologies, past and current efforts, and leading figures in the field of computational law in general, and computable contracts in particular.

** Course Structure

This is a self-study course. It's mostly readings, web pages, and some videos.

If you get stuck, ask for help on the Legalese slack chat.

* Volume 1 (two days) -- Background Survey

** Motivation and Explication

The two most important readings are marked *IMPORTANT* below. If you print anything, print those two chapters. Skim everything else, but read those.

*** American Work

1. The earliest work dates back to 1988: skim Ronald Lee's [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228185635_A_Logic_Model_for_Electronic_Contracting][A Logic Model for Electronic Contracting]].
2. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nick Szabo put forward [[http://nakamotoinstitute.org/contract-language/][a formal language for contracts]].
3. In 2011 some Argentinians published [[http://publicaciones.dc.uba.ar/Publications/2011/GMS11/gms_flacos-2011-tr.pdf][FormaLex]].
4. More recently, Flood & Goodenough published [[https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-2015-04_Contract-as-Automaton-The-Computational-Representation-of-Financial-Agreements.pdf][Contract as Automaton]] (2015, 2017).
5. In 2016, [[https://www.hklaw.com/Josias-Dewey/][Josias Dewey]] of [[http://contractcode.io/][contractcode.io]] wrote a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cun8B6V_CbedxrhW26j0ZfAfcuVKtrVOdg9tY7XR8Lw/edit][white paper]].
6. In 2017, Shrutarshi Basu, Ph.D. candidate at Cornell, wrote a conveyancing reasoner: http://basus.me/conveyor/

*** European Work

1. In the 2000s, Jean-Marc Eber wrote [[https://www.lexifi.com/files/resources/MLFiPaper.pdf][Composing Contracts: an adventure in financial engineering]]. That paper begat [[https://www.lexifi.com/product/technology/contract-description-language][MLFi]], a domain-specific language for financial contracts. Eber's company, [[https://www.lexifi.com/company][LexiFi]], sells to financial institutions.
2. In 2002, [[https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2002/1435/07/14350170b.pdf][Using Event Semantics for Modeling Contracts]] came out of the Netherlands.
3. The [[http://www.estrellaproject.org/][Estrella Project]] ran from 2006 to 2008, [[http://www.leibnizcenter.org/][out of Amsterdam]], and produced [[https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core][LKIF]], a legal ontology.
4. In 2005, Adrian Paschke at TUM.de (et al) described [[http://rbsla.ruleml.org/docs/37910209.pdf][ContractLog]] to cover SLAs.
5. From 2007 to 2010, in Norway, [[http://cosodis.project.ifi.uio.no/][the CoSoDIS project]] begat the contract language CL, under [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~gersch/][Schneider]] (in Sweden). Browse [[http://cosodis.project.ifi.uio.no/publications.shtml][publications]].
6. *IMPORTANT* -- Chapter 1 of Camilleri's 2015 [[https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/40725/1/gupea_2077_40725_1.pdf][Analysing Normative Contracts]] briefly surveys the field of computable contracts. The rest of the thesis demonstrates applications of CL: [[http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/contracts/diagrams/][contract-oriented diagrams]] (web), a [[http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/contracts/cnl/][CNL editor]] (web), and [[http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/~svrg/Tools/CLTool/][CLan]] (Java), a contract language analyzer, produced under [[http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/contracts/][the REMU project]], funded by the Swedish Research Council.
7. *IMPORTANT* -- Chapter 1 of Hvitved's 2012 [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU][Contract Formalization]] comprehensively surveys the prior art in contract languages. That chapter describes many efforts not listed here.
8. Chapter 2 introduces his language, [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU][CSL]]. CSL was developed as part of [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156783260800074X][POETS]] under the Danish Advanced Technology Foundation's [[http://web.archive.org/web/20141216182613/http://3gerp.org/][3gERP]] project. The implementation is in Haskell.

** Prior Art in Regulations, Compliance, and Rules

Contracts are private law; legislation and regulation are public law. Enterprises have internal laws, called Business Rules.

1. In Australia, [[http://www.governatori.net/research/pubs/index.html][Guido Governatori]] has been doing for legislation what the above efforts do for contracts. http://digital-legislation.net describes computable legislation and regulations; see the [[https://digital-legislation.net/img/concept-map.pdf][marketecture PDF]].
2. [[https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/monica.palmirani/en][Monica Palmirani]] chairs the [[https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml][OASIS committee]] for [[http://www.governatori.net/papers/2013/ruleml2013tutorial.pdf][LegalRuleML]] (2013 tutorial). See the [[https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/legalruleml/][mailing list archives]].
3. [[http://benjamingrosof.com/][Ben Grosof]]'s company [[http://www.coherentknowledge.com/][Coherent Knowledge]] commercializes Textual RuleLog (a Prolog variant) as Ergo, to reason through regulatory compliance. See 2016 [[variant of Textual R][YouTube demo]] (15m), 2015 [[https://www.slideshare.net/ruleml2012/ruleml2015-tutorial-powerful-practical-semantic-rules-in-rulelog-fundamentals-and-recent-progress][RuleML slides]].
4. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rules_engine][Business Rules Engines]] have been around forever: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Policy_Automation][Oracle Policy Automation]] dates back to 2008. [[https://www.neotalogic.com/][Neota Logic]] is a recent entrant. See also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drools][Drools]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_(programming_language)][Jess]], [[https://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/ilog/][iLog]].

The name for this field is "RegTech".

** Prior Art: Non-Computational Contracts

We call this the "document assembly" or "document automation" industry.

* Volume 2 (one semester) -- Introduction to L4

This volume teaches L4. It will take a few months to get productive.

As a newly fledged legal developer, you will be ready to use the language and its tools to read and write contracts-as-code and legislation-as-code.

You will be able to generate visualizations and operate the verification engine.

You can start contributing to opensource libraries of contract code. Share your work on Github.

* Volume 3 (one to two years) -- Advanced Background

There is enough material in here for a Master's degree. If you go fast, you could cover it all in a year. If you go deep, it might take two.

You will understand the mathematical logic and architectural decisions that inform the design of the L4 language.

You'll be ready to start developing and extending the core language itself, the way Guido van Rossum develops Python, the way Mats develops Ruby, the way DHH developed Rails.

When you attend academic conferences about law and logic, you will be able to follow the arguments of wizards about the fine points of action logics vs state logics; about whether Hvitved loses anything by defining permission in terms of counterparty obligations; about whether CSL or CL better sidesteps the paradoxes of Standard Deontic Logic; about whether Governatori's defeasible logics map elegantly to SBVR and LegalRuleML.
