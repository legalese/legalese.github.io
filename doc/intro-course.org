#+TITLE: An Introductory Course in Formal Languages and Protocols in Computational Law

This document lives at https://github.com/legalese/legalese.com/blob/master/doc/intro-course.org

* Introduction

This course was designed in mid-2017 to survey the field of computational contracts, which is just now emerging from academia toward industrial practice.

** Audiences

The course is intended for two audiences.

One, the non-technical reader with some experience with the legal profession, considering a career in legal engineering, unafraid to dip a toe into computer science. A bright young law student, perhaps with some natural affinity for programming, who seeks alternatives to the standard future: junior associate, senior associate, partner, corpse.

Two, the technical reader, perhaps a self-taught or [[http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/][classically educated programmer]], who is interested in approaching contract law as a special case of applied computer science.

This is not a bloodless sport. You might have parents or friends who are lawyers. As a computer geek at heart, you might feel a certain competitive urge to show that your magic is as strong as theirs. Nurture this flame. It is an authentic motivation.

There is a third type of audience. Maybe you grew up coding, but now find yourself working in law. Perhaps you are entertaining thoughts about defecting to the other camp where your first love still awaits. We can neither confirm nor deny that any such attempts will succeed. Say nothing, but blink twice if you understand.

** By the end of this course

You will gain passing acquaintance with the foundational technologies, past and current efforts, and leading figures in the field of computational law in general, and computable contracts in particular.

** Course Structure

This is a self-study course. It's mostly readings, web pages, and some videos.

If you get stuck, ask for help on the Legalese slack chat.

* Volume 1 (two days) -- Background Survey

** Motivation and Explication

1. What if we could write contracts (and statutes) the way we do programs? (Not to mention compile, test, debug, and verify ... or even share and sell.)
2. http://compk.stanford.edu/ articulates the vision.
3. Harry Surden (2014) explains computable contracts on his blog ([[http://www.harrysurden.com/wordpress/archives/203][part 1]], [[http://www.harrysurden.com/wordpress/archives/230][part 2]]).
4. Eventually, professional services will be provided around contract drafting. Wait -- law firms already do that! Except, by and large, without technology and tools. Automation is just the first step.
5. One premise of the approach in this course is that the CS field of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification][Formal Verification]] has much to offer.

** A Quick Survey of Prior Art in Computable Contracts

Ready to add some tabs to your browser?

The three most important readings are marked *IMPORTANT* below. If you print anything, print those. Skim everything else, but read those.

Computable contracts is a narrow segment of computational law, which goes back over 30 years. For a sense of the larger field, see [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259872879_The_TAXMAN_Project_Towards_a_Cognitive_Theory_of_Legal_Argument][the contents page of Computer Science and Law]] (1979), [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwNWg4d1lsSGJnSVE][the ICAIL retrospective]] (2012), and [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwNFlaNEUzd1d3RGc][slides from the intro to AI & Law workshop at ICAIL 2017]].

Meng gave [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qP7Immmo51Rik9X96KmyZPLi2zC2mGQSTgsWccq3wNA/edit#slide=id.g228038fb28_0_3][a presentation covering some of this material]] at CodeX on 2017-09-09.

*** American Work

1. The earliest work dates back to 1988: skim Ronald Lee's [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228185635_A_Logic_Model_for_Electronic_Contracting][A Logic Model for Electronic Contracting]].

3. *IMPORTANT* -- In 2011 some Argentinians published [[http://publicaciones.dc.uba.ar/Publications/2011/GMS11/gms_flacos-2011-tr.pdf][FormaLex]]. They [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwT01LUGdDMjdMRXc][followed up in 2017]].
4. More recently, Flood & Goodenough published [[https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-2015-04_Contract-as-Automaton-The-Computational-Representation-of-Financial-Agreements.pdf][Contract as Automaton]] (2015, 2017).
5. In 2016, [[https://www.hklaw.com/Josias-Dewey/][Josias Dewey]] of [[http://contractcode.io/][contractcode.io]] wrote a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cun8B6V_CbedxrhW26j0ZfAfcuVKtrVOdg9tY7XR8Lw/edit][white paper]].
6. In 2017, Shrutarshi Basu, Ph.D. candidate at Cornell, wrote a conveyancing reasoner: http://basus.me/conveyor/

*** European Work

1. In the 2000s, Jean-Marc Eber wrote [[https://www.lexifi.com/files/resources/MLFiPaper.pdf][Composing Contracts: an adventure in financial engineering]]. That paper begat [[https://www.lexifi.com/product/technology/contract-description-language][MLFi]], a domain-specific language for financial contracts. Eber's company, [[https://www.lexifi.com/company][LexiFi]], sells to financial institutions.
2. In 1999, Aspassia-Kaliopi Daskalopulu wrote a PhD thesis at the University of London on [[http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/d/AspassiaPhD.pdf][Logic-Based Tools for the Analysis and Representation of Legal Contracts]]; subsequent work explored [[https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0106009][model checking]].
3. In 2002, [[https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2002/1435/07/14350170b.pdf][Using Event Semantics for Modeling Contracts]] came out of the Netherlands.
4. The [[http://www.estrellaproject.org/][Estrella Project]] ran from 2006 to 2008, [[http://www.leibnizcenter.org/][out of Amsterdam]], and produced [[https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core][LKIF]], a legal ontology -- [[http://www.leibnizcenter.org/~winkels/LegalOntologies.html][one of many]]; see [[https://www.amazon.com/Approaches-Legal-Ontologies-Methodologies-Governance/dp/9400734751/][Approaches to Legal Ontologies]]. LKIF stands on the shoulders of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Interchange_Format][KIF]] which was a creation of Michael Genesereth at Stanford and others. See papers such as [[http://www.leibnizcenter.org/docs/hoekstra/Hoekstra-LOAIT07.pdf][The LKIF Core Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts]] which probably has some overlap with the [[http://www.estrellaproject.org/doc/D1.4-OWL-Ontology-of-Basic-Legal-Concepts.pdf][OWL Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts]].
5. In 2005, Adrian Paschke at TUM.de (et al) described [[http://rbsla.ruleml.org/docs/37910209.pdf][ContractLog]] to cover SLAs.
6. In 2007, the LegalXML OASIS working group produced the [[http://docs.oasis-open.org/legalxml-econtracts/CS01/legalxml-econtracts-specification-1.0.pdf][eContracts v1.0 specification]].
7. From 2007 to 2010, in Norway, [[http://cosodis.project.ifi.uio.no/][the CoSoDIS project]] begat the contract language CL, under [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~gersch/][Schneider]] (in Sweden). Browse [[http://cosodis.project.ifi.uio.no/publications.shtml][publications]]. Particularly, [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221027131_Model_Checking_Contracts_-_A_Case_Study][Model Checking Contracts]].
8. *IMPORTANT* -- Chapter 1 of Camilleri's 2015 [[https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/40725/1/gupea_2077_40725_1.pdf][Analysing Normative Contracts]] briefly surveys the field of computable contracts. The rest of the thesis demonstrates applications of CL: [[http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/contracts/diagrams/][contract-oriented diagrams]] (web), a [[http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/contracts/cnl/][CNL editor]] (web), and [[http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/~svrg/Tools/CLTool/][CLan]] (Java), a contract language analyzer, produced under [[http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/contracts/][the REMU project]], funded by the Swedish Research Council.
9. *IMPORTANT* -- Chapter 1 of Hvitved's 2012 [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU][Contract Formalization]] comprehensively surveys the prior art in contract languages. That chapter describes many efforts not listed here.
10. Chapter 2 introduces his language, [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU][CSL]]. CSL was developed as part of [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156783260800074X][POETS]] under the Danish Advanced Technology Foundation's [[http://web.archive.org/web/20141216182613/http://3gerp.org/][3gERP]] project. The implementation is in Haskell.
11. [[http://hdl.handle.net/10443/1814][Abdelsadiq at Newcastle]] worked on model checking also.
12. [[http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/smartlaw2017/papers/SmartLaw2017_paper_1.pdf][Eric Tjong Tjin Tai]] from Tilburg, NL, published a short paper, "[[http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/smartlaw2017/papers/SmartLaw2017_paper_1.pdf][Formalizing Contract Law for Smart Contracts]]".
13. Most contract law concerns itself primarily with deontic logic; but parties must give notice to one another, and that is epistemic logic. Some people in Amsterdam have been working on [[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-48561-3_30][model checking of epistemic logic]].

** Prior Art in Regulations, Compliance, and Rules

Contracts are private law; legislation and regulation are public law. Enterprises have internal laws, called Business Rules.

1. Vinay Gupta (2017) motivated computable legislation in his manifesto [[http://internetofagreements.com/][The Internet of Agreements]]: smart contracts need smart law.
2. In Australia, [[http://www.governatori.net/research/pubs/index.html][Guido Governatori]] has been doing for legislation what the above efforts do for contracts. http://digital-legislation.net describes computable legislation and regulations; see the [[https://digital-legislation.net/img/concept-map.pdf][marketecture PDF]]. His previous efforts include Regorous and DrContract.
3. [[https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/monica.palmirani/en][Monica Palmirani]] chairs the [[https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml][OASIS committee]] for [[http://www.governatori.net/papers/2013/ruleml2013tutorial.pdf][LegalRuleML]] (2013 tutorial). See the [[https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/legalruleml/][mailing list archives]].
4. The [[http://mirelproject.eu/index.html][MIREL Project]] (Mining and Reasoning with Legal Texts) kicked off in February 2016 and is going strong.
5. The [[https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalxml-econtracts#technical][eContracts]] standard ran from 2000 to 2007.
6. The [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080422234946/http://www.normeinrete.it/][NormeinRete]] project ran from 1999 to 2007, and has produced work such as [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260387643_xmLegesEditor_an_OpenSource_Visual_XML_Editor_for_supporting_Legal_National_Standards][xmLegesEditor]], part of the [[http://www.xmleges.org/eng/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1][XMLeges]] suite.
7. In Pittsburgh (with Matthias Grabmair), the [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2746096&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=937658292&CFTOKEN=67801372][LUIMA project]] attempts to extract semantics from regulations. See also [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266177190_On_Rule_Extraction_from_Regulations][Adam Wyner]]; and [[http://works.bepress.com/hyun_lee/2/][Applying Software Development Techniques to Statutory Drafting]].
8. [[http://www.akomantoso.org/][Akoma Ntoso]] is a markup XML for legislation.
9. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJXDM][The Global Justice XML Data Model]] is a data reference model for the exchange of information within the justice and public safety communities.

The name for this field is "RegTech".

** Some Software Projects, Companies, and Consortia

1. [[https://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/institutes-centers/center-for-access-to-justice-and-technology/a2j-author][A2JAuthor]] is a software tool that delivers greater access to justice for self-represented litigants by enabling non-technical authors from the courts, clerk's offices, legal services programs, and website editors to rapidly build and implement customer friendly web-based interfaces for document assembly.
2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rules_engine][Business Rules Engines]] have been around forever: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Policy_Automation][Oracle Policy Automation]] dates back to 2008. [[https://www.neotalogic.com/][Neota Logic]] is a recent entrant. See also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drools][Drools]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_(programming_language)][Jess]], [[https://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/ilog/][iLog]].

4. [[http://www.r3.com/][R3]] has raised a lot of money. They work with banks, because that's where the money is. They run [[https://www.eventsforce.net/r3/frontend/reg/tAgendaWebsite.csp?pageID=1976&ef_sel_menu=44&eventID=9&mode=&eventID=9][summits on smart contracts]] and have published on smart contract templates: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00771][foundations]] and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04496][requirements]] (2016). See [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxOaYa8pqqSwWTAzS3hjZUlVWUk/view?usp=sharing][slides from June 2016]] and [[https://www.r3.com/slides/third-smart-contract-templates-summit-slides.pdf][June 2017]]. Their demo runs ISDA master templates through an end-to-end proof of concept prototype against a DLT/blockchain.
5. ISDA, the trade association, encourages the use of [[https://www2.isda.org/functional-areas/technology-infrastructure/fpml/][FpML]].

* Volume 2 (one semester) -- Introduction to L4

/This section is under construction./

This volume teaches L4. It will take a few months to get productive.

As a newly fledged legal developer, you will be ready to use the language and its tools to read and write contracts-as-code and legislation-as-code.

You will be able to generate visualizations and operate the verification engine.

You can start contributing to opensource libraries of contract code. Share your work on Github.

* Volume 3 (one to two years) -- Advanced Background

/This section is under construction./

There is enough material in here for a Master's degree. If you go fast, you could cover it all in a year. If you go deep, it might take two.

You will understand the mathematical logic and architectural decisions that inform the design of the L4 language.

You'll be ready to start developing and extending the core language itself, the way Guido van Rossum develops Python, the way Mats develops Ruby, the way DHH developed Rails.

When you attend academic conferences about law and logic, you will be able to follow the arguments of wizards about the fine points of action logics vs state logics; about whether Hvitved loses anything by defining permission in terms of counterparty obligations; about whether CSL, CL, or FL better sidesteps the paradoxes of Standard Deontic Logic; about whether Governatori's defeasible logics map elegantly to SBVR and LegalRuleML.
