# Hello those of technical training!

Rumor is that you are interested in Legalese.  Before you do anything else:

1. Sign-up for Legalese's [wellwishers mailing list](http://wellwishers.lists.legalese.com) (at most one email per month).  You may also enjoy the [wellwishers archives](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.legalese.com/forum/#%21forum/wellwishers).
2. If you're into the Twitter, you can follow us at [@legalese](http://twitter.com/legalese).
3. You'll enjoy this discussion of [why a programming language](https://medium.com/@Legalese/code-is-law-is-code-4492c864f33f) instead of plain JSON.
4. See this lovely YouTube from the beautiful @virgil.  This gives you the gist: [Software Eats Contract Drafting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdcM4ZfSyPE&t=1553s&list=PL9iS6Wx384eJoSVUmIy8xrF-h9bLPqggZ&index=2) (YouTube).
5. [Email us](mailto:collective@legalese.com) for an invite to the [Slack chat](http://slack.legalese.com), and join us on the #dsl channel.


There are two possible paths for you.  They are:
(a) **Language Designing** -- doing the programming language theory to actually _build_ a domain-specific-language for contracts.
(b) **Power User** -- you don't want to design the DSL, but you do want to use it.

## The Language thus far

## Why programming in english is terrible

* [The 10M dollar comma](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-few-words-about-that-ten-million-dollar-serial-comma)

## There is a better way
* The British Nationality Act was [rewritten in Prolog](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/s/p370-sergot.pdf]) all the way back in 1986!

## The closest material thus far

These texts both start with good survey chapters. They demonstrate application possibilities and underlying formalisms for computational contracts.

* [Contract Formalization by Tom Hvitved](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU)

## Generating English from Formal Grammars (Isomorphism)
There exists a lovely framework for generating multi-lingual natural language from formal grammars.  It's called GrammaticalFramework.  As a lawyer, you'll probably be good at generating the appropriate natural language. The plan is to build a dictionary of translation of the smallest "atomic" units of logic to legal, then compose these fragments into larger texts.
