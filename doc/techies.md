## Why programming in english is terrible

## There is a better way
* The British Nationality Act was [rewritten in Prolog](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/s/p370-sergot.pdf]) all the way back in 1986!

## The closest material thus far

## Generating English from Formal Grammars (Isomorphism)
There exists a lovely framework for generating multi-lingual natural language from formal grammars.  It's called GrammaticalFramework.  As a lawyer, you'll probably be good at generating the appropriate natural language. The plan is to build a dictionary of translation of the smallest "atomic" units of logic to legal, then compose these fragments into larger texts.

* [GrammaticalFramework SummerSchool](http://school.grammaticalframework.org/2017/) on 14th–25th August 2017
* [LegalRuleML](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml/) is an open standard for expressing legal rules (such as legislation) in XML.
