*** the docs and the app are free. you pay for a downstream stage.

**** google app is free

**** access to document

**** user pays for putting the PDF into an e-signing service.


* Possible revenue models for Legalese
** allow in-house counsel to do private cloud.
but why aren't in-house counsel already using an existing document assembly solution?
** is there an opportunity for brandsoftheworld.com for entity data like UEN, address, etc?
** remove the "prepared by Legalese.io" watermark
** change the font
** allow the end user to customize by adding a logo
** pay us with a promissory note -- after you get funded, you pay us $1000.
** number of agreements per month -- first docset is free, subsequent are X bucks
** priority compilation – float to the top of the processing queue so the PDFs appear in 5 minutes rather than 20 minutes
** PDF is free, Word costs.
** download the Word version of the agreement
** auto-insert into EchoSign
** contract lifecycle management
** and interactions with corporate calendar on deliverables, renewals, expiration dates, probation dates, etc etc that trigger actions.
charge money to create calendar entries or entries in your task management system
** customize the agreement using Google Docs
** private templates
** advisory servces for startups to review the terms and give an opinion regarding valuation.
** due diligence services for investors to ask us to look over a startup.
** consultation service work to import new agreements (this moves closer to the hotdocs business)
** too lazy to input your own date? for a fee we search bizfile to construct your cap table
** you send us a copy of all of your corporate documentation and we construct your cap table for you
** we refer you to a corp sec to get things cleaned up, for a referral fee
** we construct a cap table for you on eshares, captable.io, or other website for a low fee of say $400
** e-signing revenue share: $10 for each document pushed through for signature
maybe e-signing is a FNAP, and the whole product for e-signature actually rides on top of something else major.
** donations lol
** qryo-style QR codes on each page redirecting to the authoritative page in a document repository
** Investor Channels
support accelerators, incubators, angel associations, and seed funds as channels; revenue share with them.
** pledge
upon raising Series A the startup pledges to pay $6,000 to legalese.
