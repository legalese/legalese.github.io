<p>
Ever since Ethereum was conceived in 2013, critics have quipped: "Smart contracts are neither smart nor contracts".
</p>

<p>
Four years later, computer scientists are responding: "Challenge accepted!"
</p>

<p>
For context, this paper surveys the past and present of computational law. The history of software suggests a future for law: legacy formats and traditional jurisprudence are on a collision course with trustless blockchains and opensource legal engineering.
</p>

<p>
What industry initiatives are afoot in the world of blockchain smart contracts? From what wells of academia do they draw inspiration? What insights from computer science could transfer to the world of legal reasoning and drafting? If tomorrow's consumers of legal services turn first to self-help apps and chatbots, before resorting to human "tech support", will the practices of tomorrow's lawyers look more like those of software engineers?

<h2 id="org78f28ce"><span class="section-number-2">2</span>Two Traditions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This paper was written at the end of July 2017. It was an exciting month: in the span of three short weeks, five separate initiatives were announced, all with the same stated goal: to bridge the brave new world of blockchain "smart contracts" with the ancient traditions of law.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean? It means surrounding the automated execution of on-chain Ethereum bytecode with the exception-handling mechanisms of real-world dispute resolution. It means translating written rituals of offer and agreement, employing stylized phrases dating back centuries, into the cold, clean semantics of formal logic.
</p>

<p>
This paper labels this family of initiatives "smart contract templates", or SCTs.
</p>

<p>
SCTs represent a marriage between two noble families, each proud with history, but rooted in different cultures.

<h2 id="orgdad92c3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span>Contract Templates</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The first, and older, tradition is that of the lawyer: the legal draftsman, the scribe, the notary. This is the tradition also of the handbook of model forms, of the clause bank of contract templates, of copy-and-paste and fill-in-the-blanks.
</p>

<p>
Model templates reflect the mundane fact that commercial relationships run to a finite set of genres: the rental or sale of assets; the borrowing and lending of money; equity investment and divestment; a fee for services, as contractor or employee. Just as brides and grooms around the world recite the words "in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, till death do us part", business everywhere happily reuse the same sets of stock phrases to memorialize their relationships. In 2016 a contract carved in stone was unearthed in a Dionysian temple on the Anatolian coast: it was a student rental, in which tenants would be penalized for damages and were required to provide guarantors. It was found to be 2,200 years old.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Most contract templates are coarse-grained: they fill in the blanks at the level of the document. If customizations need to be made then different document templates need to be constructed. There is often significant textual overlap between such templates. Y Combinator, for example, provides a template for an investment agreement called a SAFE. SAFEs can be configured with or without a valuation cap, and with or without a discount rate: two configurables, hence four variants. Accordingly, Y Combinator's web site offers four Word documents for download. If it had three configurables, there would be eight variants; four configurables, sixteen.
</p>

<h3 id="org1a9cf72"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span>First-Generation Document Assembly</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
This exponential increase presents an obvious opportunity for software smarts: composable clause libraries and conditional logic. In the 1980s and 1990s, the advent of desktop publishing led to the first wave of document assembly, or document automation, systems &#x2013; DAs for short. DAs helped automate business processes: salespeople could quickly generate their own agreements from templates previously blessed by legal.
</p>

<p>
DAs had much in common with the venerable mail merge: the key operation was "fill in the blanks", the key object the template, and the key logic "how do we compose templates together?" The key output: a natural language document typically intended for signature by both parties. DA systems offer an attractive combination of business-user-friendliness and software flexibility. In the 1980s, early A.I. &#x2013; expert systems and decision trees &#x2013; organized templates and guided end-users through the process of filling in the blanks.
</p>

<p>
In the legal domain, first-generation DA systems include HotDocs, ContractExpress, and Exari. Most of these systems were developed in the 1990s and 2000s as proprietary enterprise software, serving law firms and big companies.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Note that we are <i>not</i> talking about legal <i>markup</i> languages: the idea of adding logical, rather than physical, structure to a document (heading levels 1, 2, 3 as opposed to font sizes 24, 18, 15) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05081.pdf">regularly occurs to individuals</a>, and initiatives such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_XML">Legal XML</a> and <a href="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</a> serve this need. But they do not attempt to capture the semantics of the document.

<div id="outline-container-org26a20d8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org26a20d8"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span>Ricardian Contracts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
"Fill in the blanks" leads to the idea of recording data values in a database, separate from their templates. Digitization leads to the idea that a contract could enjoy a purely paperless existence from start to finish.
</p>

<p>
These ideas were examined by Ian Grigg in the exploration of a system to publish and issue digitalised bond contracts on the net. It seemed intuitive that the nature of bond contracts, being mostly the same, should be amenable to a database or templating structure. But, mindful of the many other contracts that were possible such as cash, derivatives, shares, Grigg decided that there was such variability that a document automation mechanism would distract from the real problem of creating a digital contract. Grigg eschewed templates and databases altogether and instead invented a form that let the scribe create the contract in the old way &#x2013; by copying an existing contract and changing it to suit, without the assistance of automation in the drafting of the contract.
</p>

<p>
The result, known as the "Ricardian contract", is a document layout paired with a markup language to set basic parameters that were of interest to a software program. The data structure follows some standard format, which an XML purist would call a DTD schema. The template matching a schema could be a natural-language document intended for humans &#x2013; or a program intended for computers. Finally the document would be given legal effect by some kind of digital signature, linked cryptographically to the identities of the parties.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the Ricardian contract was not to solve the templating or legal prose re-use problem but instead to solve the sharing problem: how do human parties and software share and interpret the same contract?

Second-generation DA systems, which this paper will call SCT2 systems, continued the document automation tradition into the 2010s. They address the problem posed by the Ricardian Contract. They tend toward opensource and Web technologies like Javascript. <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/">CommonAccord</a> and <a href="https://commonform.org/">CommonForm</a> are examples of the opensource generation of smart contract templates. These two do not have blockchain ambitions, but many SCT2 systems do.

<p>
The above tradition, descending from law and spanning two generations of software, interprets the term "Smart Contract Templates" as contract templates that are, in some sense, smart.
</p>

<p>
But that is not the only tradition, and not the only interpretation. There is another tradition, with another interpretation.

<h2 id="org6929654"><span class="section-number-2">4</span>Smart Contracts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
In the early 1990s, Nick Szabo proposed "smart contracts"<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>: agreements that were not just digital and machine-readable, but also formalized and machine-executable. Not mere PDFs or XMLs, but <i>programs</i>, describing the obligations of the parties and the rules of their interaction in code that a computer could interpret and reason over.
</p>

<p>
Such a contract would be suitable for automated execution. One example: a vending machine<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, simple enough to be described as a deterministic finite automaton, or DFA. Another example: a financial futures contract<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, also simple enough to be described as a DFA<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. DFAs, and their cousin the Petri net<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>, have an interesting and useful property: they are amenable to a powerful formal verification technique called model checking, which employs a special engine called a SAT solver.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5cec400" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5cec400"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span>Formal Verification with Model Checking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Think of a SAT solver as a black box with two inputs. On one hand, like Paul Muad'dib swallowing Water of Life to enter a clairvoyant trance<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>, a SAT solver swallows a program and prepares to contemplate every possible future envisaged by the code.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a SAT solver accepts a specification, in which you assert certain safety or liveness properties that you believe the contract should respect &#x2013; in other words, a specific prophecy. Specialized logics called LTL and CTL<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> are used to incant these prophecies.
</p>

<p>
Given these inputs, the SAT solver looks across all possible futures in search of a <i>counterexample</i>, in which &#x2013; depending on how you asked the question &#x2013; either the prophecy is fulfilled, or the prophecy fails. Computer scientists call this "model checking". It is akin to what computers do when they play checkers or chess: they peer into the future in search of a specific scenario.
</p>

<p>
In 1994, the FDIV bug<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> cost Intel over $400 million in recalls, and galvanized the field of model checking. Ever since, hardware engineers &#x2013; microchip designers &#x2013; have employed model checking to prove that their designs will work correctly when fabbed to silicon. In the immensely competitive, billion-dollar business of CPU manufacturing, errors are simply unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
Since 1994, multiple mature software packages<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup> have been developed to be capable of this work.
</p>

<p>
What does this have to do with contracts? Business contracts can be worth billions of dollars. Mistakes in contracts can also cost millions, as lawsuits over the Oxford comma have demonstrated (in Canada in 2006<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>, and in the US in 2017<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>).

<p>
Yet the legal field has nothing like the testing tools that programmers enjoy. Programmers have developed an extensive arsenal in their war on bugs. Formal verification is just one tool; others include unit testing, linting, fuzzing, and static type checking.
</p>

<p>
In 1978, Layman Allen wrote in <a href="http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&amp;context=articles">Normalized Legal Drafting and the Query Method</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Although there is no disagreement about the fundamental importance of language in law, there is little satisfaction expressed (and much dissatisfaction does appear in print) about the written performances of lawyers. In the eyes of some critics the profession's use of language is so inept as to give rise to suspicions about motives and competency.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thirty years later, the situation had not improved. Darmstadter 2010<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup> compared contract drafting with software engineering:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But compared to the testing engineers and programmers do, the testing of legal documents is hopelessly backward. Essentially, someone drafts the document and other people read it. If they notice problems, they alert the draftsman, who makes some changes. That's it. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given the similarities between the fields, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to formalize contracts, and to formally verify them. Model checking of contracts was first demonstrated in 2006 by Pace, Prisacariu, and Schneider.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> (See also <a href="https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/handle/10443/1814">Abdelsadiq</a> 2013.) Model checking of legislation was demonstrated by Fernando Schapachnik et al in 2011<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
In financial markets, <a href="https://www.imandra.ai/">Imandra</a> performs formal verification of financial algorithms operating at stock exchanges.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
As the term suggests, formal verification requires a contract to first be formalized: translated into a logical notation for which an explicit, unambiguous formal semantics has been defined.<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup> In other words, into a program, written in some programming language specialized for law.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc14ac5b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc14ac5b"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span>Formal Languages for Law</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Financial contracts were the first to be formalized. Special-purpose contract languages have been developed, along Ricardian lines, within the limited domain of financial agreements: examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FpML">FpML</a> (1999) and Lexifi's <a href="https://www.lexifi.com/product/technology/contract-description-language">MLFi</a> (2000).
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, more general-purpose languages for contract formalization have been developed in academia. The most relevant:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CL (Contract Language) by Pace and Schneider was the subject of John Camilleri's 2016 thesis work<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup>;</li>
<li>CSL (Contract Specification Language) was the subject of Tom Hvitved's 2013 PhD thesis<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup>;</li>
<li>FormaLex<sup><a id="fnr.15.100" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup> by Schapachnik has been ongoing from 2011 to 2017.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These languages typically borrow from modal logic:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>deontics define the obligations and prohibitions of parties;</li>
<li>temporal logics describe events and <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=940106">fluents</a> in time;</li>
<li>epistemic logics (approximately, CCS, CSP, and process calculi) formalize the sending and receiving of notices among parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Contract languages also borrow from rule logics, of which more later.
</p>

<p>
This tradition of academic research evolved slowly and steadily, elaborating Szabo's original vision for smart contracts. The term seemed apt to describe a born-digital contract which took shape first as a program in a text editor. That program might later compile to a Word document or a PDF, but such projections were only shadows cast upon a cave wall by the Platonic ideal of the smart contract code.
</p>

<p>
Then, in the 2010s, a handful of billionaire anarchists co-opted the term "smart contract" and gave it a new meaning.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org82fbcc1" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
While one corner of academia toiled away at contract formalization and verification, another obscure corner of cypherpunk crypto-anarchists were fomenting a revolution that would change the world. In their hands, cryptography 1.0 (which concerned itself with message encryption and endpoint authentication) was reborn as cryptography 2.0, which repurposed hashes for proof-of-work, and repurposed public keys to sign irrevocable ledgers.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin launched in 2011. Ethereum launched in 2015. Since then the market cap of those and other cryptocurrencies has risen, collectively, to over $80B.
</p>

<p>
These blockchain technologies provided the missing element of Szabo's original vision: a tamper-proof, globally accessible cryptographic ledger on which the "world computer" &#x2013; the Ethereum virtual machine &#x2013; could be built; and on that EVM, contracts could be run.
</p>

<p>
These programs, amenable to automated, trustless execution, were labeled "smart contracts". And, sure as night follows the day, smart contracts turned out to be just as fallible any other program: they had bugs.<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In fintech, bugs are security vulnerabilities; attackers are highly motivated; and exploits cost money. Entire wallets can be drained. Millions can be lost.
</p>

<p>
The first major attack on an Ethereum smart contract happened in June 2016, when TheDAO began draining due to a bug in the Ethereum smart contract. In its wake came calls for better security.
</p>

<p>
Security is a multi-pronged challenge with no silver bullet. Techniques include audits<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21">21</a></sup>; language-based security<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22">22</a></sup>; and formal verification<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23">23</a></sup>. But security is always easier said than done: in July 2017 the Parity multisig bug hit.<sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24">24</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Whereas traditional law represents centuries of accumulated experience with disputes of all kinds, the first generation of cryptocurrencies deliberately excluded dispute resolution as being inconsistent with the decentralization ethos. As a consequence, you can't have a lawsuit in Ethereum; you can only have a constitutional crisis.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://www.codereactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ethereum-unstoppable.jpg" alt="ethereum-unstoppable.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The hard-fork which followed the TheDAO incident amounted to a central intervention in an obstensibly decentralized cryptocurrency. This event highlighted the need for a more robust governance model.<sup><a id="fnr.25" class="footref" href="#fn.25">25</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Partly in response to Ethereum's perceived security failings<sup><a id="fnr.20.100" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup>, and partly in response to Ethereum's perceived governance failings, Tezos launched. Tezos containd two innovations. First, a new smart contract blockchain and language (called Michelson) based on a stack-based virtual machine, suitable for formal verification. Second, a promise of more democratic distributd governance: essentially, a "by the people, for the people, of the people" for the blockchain generation. They raised the largest ICO in history: over $200M.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-5">
<p>
All of these smart contract initiatives have one thing in common.
</p>

<p>
Most commercial agreements fall into a small number of known genres. Most software programs can be classified into a small number of categories. It stands to reason that smart contracts &#x2013; which are both commercial agreements and software artefacts &#x2013; will also end up organized by genre.
</p>

<p>
Two software dynamics will then drive the evolution of smart contract software.
</p>

<p>
First, mature software engineers prefer not to write software, if at all possible; rather than reinvent the wheel, they would much rather reuse a tried-and-tested library. A library and a template have much in common: they are reusable, customizable, standard components.
</p>

<p>
Second, the technical difficulty of developing secure software libraries will drive down the number of widely-respected, generally accepted alternatives.
</p>

<p>
So the result will be a relatively small number of smart contract libraries which have both passed rigorous formal verification, and been widely adopted. These libraries will be the smart-contract world's answer to the idea of a model form contract template.
</p>

<p>
From this perspective, SCTs are templates for smart contracts: (smart contract) (templates).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In the legal tradition, where computerization has brought smarts to contract templates, SCT means (smart) (contract templates).
</p>

<p>
In the software tradition, research into contract formalization and the crypto 2.0 rise of blockchain smart contracts mean that SCT stands for (smart contract) (templates).
</p>

<p>
In July 2017, these traditions finally met, like Montagues and Capulets colliding.
</p>

<p>
In yet another example of multiple discovery, five matchmakers came almost simultaneously to the conclusion that it was time for Romeo to kiss Juliet.
</p>

<p>
This paper follows the lead set by R3, in which the term "Smart Contract Templates" is meant to invoke a sense of integrating across both traditions, both interpretations.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
The matchmakers envision a bridge between smart contracts and natural language contracts. Libraries of contract templates will emerge, with a foot in each world. Once the blanks are filled in, the contracts will take shape both as Ethereum smart contracts and as PDF or docx paperwork suitable for parties to sign.
</p>

<p>
This paper calls such dual-use smart contract templates "Generation 2.5 SCT" systems, or SCT2.5 for short.
</p>

<p>
In July 2017 alone, five new SCT2.5 systems were announced &#x2013; two on the same day. All are in development and none are widely used at time of writing.

DA and SCT2 systems are sufficient to solve several classes of problems.
</p>

<p>
To get multilingual contracts, simply extend the singular template into a list of concrete languages: the same values can fill multiple blanks.
</p>

<p>
When circumstances demand customization, refactor the templates at the appropriate level of granularity and extend the logic to compose accordingly, based on decision variables in the code.
</p>

Customization is a function of expressiveness: the more expressive the system, the easier it is to customize.

The semantics of a contract reside in natural language. The advent of cryptocurrencies brings an increasing demand for integration between natural language and blockchain-native smart contracts. However, DA systems are limited to filling static values into static blanks.

<p>
Most programming environments offer a standard set of conveniences: mathematical expressions, if/then/else logic, lambda functions, and function calls. None of these are expressible in the original design of the Ricardian contract.
</p>

<p>
A computer scientist would say that, at best, the notion of a Ricardian contract, which has its roots in templates and database tables, lacks a rich expression language; at worst, it lacks first-class functions.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-3">
<p>
Just as database design and administration tends to end up the specialty of the DBA, customization of contract templates requires specialized knowledge which tends to accumulate in the department of the "contract template admin". It would be better for this capability to be distributed throughout the organization, along the lines of the computer literacy movement that says everyone should be able to code.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-4">
<p>
In Model-View-Controller lingo, 1st and 2nd generation DA/SCT systems tend to intermingle the presentation view with the business logic of the data model. There are no clean boundary layer separations: a single template may contain chunks of hardcoded text, output formatting instructions, data blanks, and logical directives to show/hide.
</p>

<p>
Such a structure is unclean. What if you want not just one language but a multilingual family of templates? If all the functionality initially lives in a single template file, copying the template file to a different language means duplicating the logic. Changing the logic means visiting all the templates. Extending a new blank field to the template family means editing all the templates. This is not i18n/L10n best practice, nor is it MVC best practice.

<h2 id="org8e10e17"><span class="section-number-2">9</span>3rd generation smart contract templates</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
To overcome these limitations, some have proposed to take the Ricardian contract to the next level: to encode not just the data values but the full logical semantics of a contract.
</p>

<p>
3rd generation SCT systems (SCT3), as described by <a href="http://contractcode.io/">contractcode.io</a> and <a href="http://compk.stanford.edu/">compk.stanford.edu</a>, solve many of these problems. Harry Surden has written extensively on <a href="http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/46/2/articles/46-2_surden.pdf">Computable Contracts</a>, describing the possibilities of 3rd generation systems and anticipating the challenges of deeply integrating expressive code with the legacy legal system.
</p>

<p>
In an SCT3 system, a domain-specific programming language (DSL) is provided to express the logical semantics of a contract. The DSL goes beyond key/value Ricardian template filling, and begins to resemble a Turing-complete programming language. (For esoteric reasons, it is likely that an SCT3 system will stop short of Turing-completeness, trading off expressive power for decidability and provability.)
</p>

<p>
The toolchain for that DSL operates in multiple stages.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="orgedfaa46"><span class="section-number-3">9.1</span>Opensource Templates</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
We assume that, as with a 2nd gen SCT, a library of 3rd gen templates are available in some opensource repository, easily imported by a program, the way NPM has made Node modules easy to import. As with Node modules, SCT3 templates could be sized at any level of functionality, from a sentence fragment (for Oxford commas) to a standard exemption clause to an entire contract workflow (such as a SAFE plus its sides).
</p>

<p>
We preserve the Ricardian notion of separating data from template, but the data itself can contain code: rich expressions that the toolchain knows how to reduce to natural language and smart contract primitives.

<h3 id="org38fdbac"><span class="section-number-3">9.2</span>Compiler Toolchain</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
Stage 1 (the lexer/parser) compiles programs written in that DSL into an intermediate form representing the contract in the abstract &#x2013; what one might recognize as being akin to a Gen 2 smart contract template, but highly structured and with semantics fully available for inspection and evaluation.
</p>

<p>
Stage 2 (the template filler) takes the output of Stage 1, adds the particulars of a contract instance (parties, configured terms and conditions, etc), and produces an abstract grammar, losslessly preserving all the semantics of the source template and data/expression values.
</p>

<p>
Stage 3 (natural language generator) is a computational linguistics system responsible for concretizing the abstract grammar from Stage 2 into one or more natural languages, at the highest possible degree of granularity: individual words and parts-of-speech, where possible, and with canned blocks of text otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Other stages may be connected up in parallel to this primary pipeline. For example, the compiler may delegate to an offboard static analyzer which performs compile-time bug-finding.

<p>
Unification between blockchain smart contracts and legacy paper is the goal of several SCT2.5 systems. Their template orientation means that Gen 2.5 SCT systems will be able to bridge the gap, albeit crudely.
</p>

<p>
In 2016, Lee Braine and Chris Clack, members of the R3 project, wrote a couple of papers about Smart Contract Templates:
</p>

<h2 id="orgb0aa3df"><span class="section-number-2">11</span>Why a DSL?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
Is there a direction, a teleology to the evolution of SCT systems? The history of the Web offers a compelling analogy.
</p>

<p>
One of the first technologies to make the Web interactive was the Server-Side Include<sup><a id="fnr.26" class="footref" href="#fn.26">26</a></sup>: a crude templating system capable of stitching together individual HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Then came PHP, originally named "Personal Home Page / Forms Interpreter". The "Forms" element is a strong clue that analogy with key/value-driven Gen 1 DA and Gen 2 SCT systems is appropriate. The PHP-era web could be described as being made of "Ricardian web pages", where templates are personalized by filling in the blanks to suit each user, in a structured document containing both text and data extracted from SQL databases by a server back-end and piped statically to the client's browser.
</p>

<p>
PHP author Rasmus Lerdorf said: "there was never any intent to write a programming language […] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way." This is the organic evolutionary process that takes us to Gen 2.5 SCT today: feature after feature accreting in response to demand for stitching together online databases with real-world transactions; e-commerce is the obvious example.
</p>

<p>
In 2017, the dominant paradigm on today's web is the web app powered by client-side Javascript. Web apps are enabled by the ability to run Turing-complete code in a sandbox, in the user's browser, communicating with servers using JSON. These apps are supported by an ecosystem of Javascript libraries easily remixed and reused by developers. The analogy is again clear: the kingdom comes; it will be done, in legal as it is in browsers. That is where the third generation of SCT systems is headed.
</p>

<p>
To elaborate this argument, let us examine another analogy from the history of computer science: this is the story of the move to increasingly abstract high-level languages.

A JSON-style key/value approach may make sense for a standalone lawyer producing first-cut documents, but those documents better be in Word format, because the other side will want to edit them, and you’re back to the original problem again.

Does that remind you of something? The last time I felt this way was when I opened a binary executable in a hex editor. And that was a long, long time ago. Remember the 1980s? The era of proprietary software, before the Internet, when people shared programs on floppy disks. Not as source code, but as binaries. I remember turning on cheat codes by opening up .EXE files and twiddling specific address locations.
</p>

<p>
Binary code consists of machine instructions intended for CPUs. Editing raw binary is a dangerous thing; a single change in one spot often implies a cascade of changes throughout the rest of the file.
</p>

<p>
No wonder one of the very first inventions in computer science was the compiler. A programmer writes source code in a high level language to work out the solution to a software problem, function by function, module by module, the way a screenwriter writes a script to work out the plot of their story, line by line, scene by scene. Then the screenplay enters production and turns into a few gigabytes of MPEG data; the source code enters a compiler and turns into a few megabytes of machine code. Every time the source code changes, the compiler rebuilds the binary.
</p>

<p>
In that sense, a contract template &#x2013; say, a Word document with yellow blanks &#x2013; is a special kind of machine binary. If you're an end-user you may fill in the assigned blanks, but don't touch anything else! Because you haven't been ordained &#x2013; you're not in the priesthood.
</p>

<p>
But the life cycle of many business contracts involves some degree of negotiation. Yes, some contracts are take-it-or-leave-it<sup><a id="fnr.27" class="footref" href="#fn.27">27</a></sup>. But most B2B contracts ping-pong back and forth several times before the parties commit to signature. That means lots of editing.
</p>

<p>
Today, that editing happens at the level of the compiled binary. It should happen at the level of source code.
</p>

<p>
What happens when your counterparty wants to add a new clause in the middle of your template blocks? You have to “recompile” &#x2013; update all the cross-references and adjust the clauses to match the change. And that's just at the surface level. What about deeper changes to the semantics? That is, after all, the point of negotiation. One change to the deal could entail half a dozen changes in the contract.
</p>

<p>
Where, then, is the source code for a business contract, for a piece of legislation? Largely in the heads of lawyers, it turns out. The closest thing to a high-level language version of a contract is a term sheet: a one-page version summarizing the configuration of the deal, which "definitive documentation" subsequently details.
</p>

<p>
Today, lawyers are human compilers, just as there used to be human computers. But we’ve seen this show before; we know what comes next. High-level languages. Reusable, modular libraries. Open source.

<h2 id="org7cae27c"><span class="section-number-2">13</span>Example: SCT2 versus SCT3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
Let's look at an example of how SCT2 and SCT3 systems handle a common contract situation differently.
</p>

<p>
Suppose a startup investment agreement, such as a SAFE or a KISS, contemplates conversion to equity in some future round. To avoid premature conversion and dilution, the triggering round must be of a certain minimum size. So the language in a contract might be:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Next Equity Financing means the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its Preferred Stock following the Date of Issuance from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than MIN_PROCEEDS (excluding the aggregate amount of securities converted into Common or Preferred Stock in connection with such sale (or series of related sales)).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A 2nd generation SCT system might organize this template as follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{ "template": "Next Equity Financing means the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its Preferred Stock following the Date of Issuance from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than {{MIN_PROCEEDS}} (excluding the aggregate amount of securities converted into Common or Preferred Stock in connection with such sale (or series of related sales)).",
  "vars": {
    "MIN_PROCEEDS": "US$2,000,000",
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is consistent with the original vision of the Ricardian Contract: a text template with an accompanying dictionary of key-value pairs.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, after negotiation, the parties agree to measure the size of the round in two ways instead of one. They revise the template:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{ "template": "Next Equity Financing means the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its Preferred Stock following the Date of Issuance from which the Company:--
- receives gross proceeds of not less than {{MIN_PROCEEDS}} (excluding the aggregate amount of securities converted into Common or Preferred Stock in connection with such sale (or series of related sales)); or
- is valued (prior to the sale (or series of related sales)) at no less than {{MIN_VALUATION}} (excluding the conversion of this instrument and other instruments of this type, and of convertible promissory notes).",
  "vars": {
    "MIN_PROCEEDS":   "US$2,000,000",
    "MIN_VALUATION": "US$10,000,000"
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is good 2nd-generation work. How would this look in a 3rd-generation SCT?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">nef :: Definition FinancingRound = (en "Next Equity Financing")
    first [ round | round &lt;- company.financingRounds
          , round.date after my.dateOfIssuance
          , round.instrument instanceof PreferredStock
          , ( round.proceeds &gt; min_proceeds ||
              round.preMoneyValuation &gt; min_valuation )
          ] where min_proceeds  = USD 2000000
                  min_valuation = USD 10000000
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The template has become a program! The semantics have been formalized. The parties can now negotiate unambiguously about the meaning of the contract, trusting to the compiler to faithfully turn the program into natural language.
</p>

<p>
To do this, the compiler must know how to convert a wide range of possible expressions to natural language. This is a tractable problem and solutions have been demonstrated in the literature.
</p>

<p>
If further negotiation results in more changes to the program, no problem: changes to the text will follow automatically.
</p>

<p>
This approach is not possible in a 2nd-generation SCT system. It is only possible in a 3rd-generation system.
</p>

<p>
3rd gen systems enjoy a number of advantages over 1st and 2nd gen SCTs.

The bulk of wordsmithing energy in the legal industry today is spent on specific contracts. Moving this effort to contract templates improves reusability.

<h3 id="orgc813506"><span class="section-number-3">13.9</span>Github for Law</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-9">
<p>
The idea of "Github for Law" belongs more to the world of 3rd-generation SCT than 2nd-generation.
</p>

<p>
In the absence of SCT3 source code, a "Github for Law" is really a warez site, full of suspect, immutable binaries. PDFs and Word docs are not source code. They are executables.
</p>

<p>
Going from SCT2 to SCT3 is a fundamental transition, which even the ancients would recognize as a giant step forward. The linguistic distinction between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in law can be found in the words of Publius Juventius Celsus two thousand years ago:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Scire leges non hoc est verba earum tenere sed vim ac potestatem</i>: "To know the law is not merely to understand the words, but as well their force and effect." (Justinian, Digest, Book 1, Title 3, 17)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For the first time in history we can move into a machine not just the words, but the understanding of the words, and the understanding of their force and effect.

<h2 id="orga3966bd"><span class="section-number-2">14</span>Smart Statutes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
So far we have dealt mostly with contracts. Contracts are private law. What about public law &#x2013; legislation and regulation?
</p>

<p>
While the idea of computable law is strongly aligned with the age-old school of legal formalism<sup><a id="fnr.29" class="footref" href="#fn.29">29</a></sup>, the most recent motivation for computable law comes from the world of smart contracts: in his <a href="http://internetofagreements.com/">InternetOfAgreements.com</a> paper, Vinay Gupta argued that smart contracts attempting to engage with the real world need to know the real world's rules, if they are to obey them. Hence the need for a "Regulatory Oracle".
</p>

<p>
The earliest work in this space dates back to 1986: researchers translated the British Nationality Act into Prolog.<sup><a id="fnr.30" class="footref" href="#fn.30">30</a></sup> Since then, several initiatives have attempted to provide frameworks for converting law into code upon which a machine can reason.<sup><a id="fnr.31" class="footref" href="#fn.31">31</a></sup> The current bottleneck is formalization: translation takes time and is fraught with interpretive issues.<sup><a id="fnr.32" class="footref" href="#fn.32">32</a></sup> This work has been done by companies such as Intuit and commercialized in the form of products like TurboTax, which represent a user-friendly formalization of the tax code.
</p>

<p>
Other verticals will follow. Sooner or later some country will muster the political will to fund the translation of their law into a formal structure; the first country to do this may enjoy economic benefits as smart contracts flow toward that jurisdiction. The Swiss canton of Zug is vying for this title.<sup><a id="fnr.33" class="footref" href="#fn.33">33</a></sup> So is Singapore.<sup><a id="fnr.34" class="footref" href="#fn.34">34</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Laws are rules for society. Rules are their own subject of research in computer science; approaches to the topic include logic programming, recently updated by Kowalski and Sadri's LPS<sup><a id="fnr.35" class="footref" href="#fn.35">35</a></sup>; RuleLog<sup><a id="fnr.36" class="footref" href="#fn.36">36</a></sup>; and RuleML<sup><a id="fnr.37" class="footref" href="#fn.37">37</a></sup>. Reaction rules (the if/then constructs that are the mainstay of imperative programming languages) forward-chain from facts to conclusions. Deliberation, or deduction, rules (typically structured as Horn clauses in logic programming languages) backward-chain from consequent to antecedent. The RuleML standard emerged from work on the Semantic Web, and is being specialized for law in the form of LegalRuleML<sup><a id="fnr.38" class="footref" href="#fn.38">38</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Rules may conflict. Defeasible logics<sup><a id="fnr.39" class="footref" href="#fn.39">39</a></sup> help resolve these conflicts using exceptions, priorities, and meta-rules.

<p>
Amber fast-forwards through the dynamic chunks of the README—boring legal UML diagrams, mostly—soaking up the gist of the plan. Yemen is one of the few countries to implement traditional Sunni shari'a law and a limited liability company scam at the same time. Owning slaves is legal—the fiction is that the owner has an option hedged on the indentured laborer's future output, with interest payments that grow faster than the unfortunate victim can pay them off—and companies are legal entities. If Amber sells herself into slavery to this company, she will become a slave and the company will be legally liable for her actions and upkeep. The rest of the legal instrument—about ninety percent of it, in fact—is a set of self-modifying corporate mechanisms coded in a variety of jurisdictions that permit Turing-complete company constitutions, and which act as an ownership shell for the slavery contract. At the far end of the corporate shell game is a trust fund of which Amber is the prime beneficiary and shareholder. When she reaches the age of majority, she'll acquire total control over all the companies in the network and can dissolve her slave contract; until then, the trust fund (which she essentially owns) oversees the company that owns her (and keeps it safe from hostile takeover bids). Oh, and the company network is primed by an extraordinary general meeting that instructed it to move the trust's assets to Paris immediately. A one-way airline ticket is enclosed.

<p>
The Golden Age, John C. Wright<sup><a id="fnr.41" class="footref" href="#fn.41">41</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
He now nodded at Phaethon, and said, “Well, gentlemen! Shall we go in?” and he opened the tall antechamber doors with a gesture of his baton.
</p>

<p>
The Chamber of the Curia was austere. As Phaethon had guessed, it was done in the spartan style of the Objective Aesthetic.
</p>

<p>
Unadorned square silver pillars held up a black dome. In the center of the dome, at the highest point of the ceiling, a wide lens of crystal supported the pool overhead. Light from the world above fell through the water to form trembling nets and webs across the floor. The floor itself was inscribed with a mosaic in the data-pattern mode, representing the entire body of the Curia case law. At the center, small icons representing constitutional principles sent out lines to each case in which they were quoted; bright lines for controlling precedent, dim lines for dissenting opinions or dicta. Each case quoted in a later case sent out additional lines, till the concentric circles of floor-icons were meshed in a complex network.
</p>

<p>
The jest of the architect was clear to Phaethon. The floor mosaic was meant to represent the fixed immutability of the law; but the play of light from the pool above made it seem to ripple and sway and change with each little breeze.
</p>

<p>
Above the floor, not touching it, without sound or motion, hovered three massive cubes of black material.
</p>

<p>
These cubes were the manifestations of the Judges. The cube shape symbolized the solidity and implacable majesty of the law. Their high position showed they were above emotionalism or earthly appeals. The crown of each cube bore a thick-armed double helix of heavy gold.
</p>

<p>
The gold spirals atop the black cubes were symbols of life, motion, and energy. Perhaps they represented the active intellects of the Curia. Or perhaps they represented that life and civilization rested on the solid foundations of the law. If so, this was another jest of the architect. The law, it seemed, rested on nothing. Phaethon remembered that Ao Nisibus had been a Warlock, after all.
</p>

<p>
“Oyez, oyez!” cried Atkins, rapping the heel of his baton against the floor with a crack of noise. “All persons having business with the Honorable Appellate Court of the Foederal Oecumenical Commonwealth in the matter of the estate of Helion Prime Rhadamanthus draw nigh! Order is established, Your Lordships, the seals are placed, the recordings proceed.”
</p>

<p>
A sense of impalpable pressure, a tension in the air, an undefined sensation of being scrutinized: these were the only clues to Phaethon that the cubes were now occupied by the intelligence of the Curia.
</p>

<p>
Once, long ago, these had been men. Now, recorded into an electrophotonic matrix, they were without passion or favoritism, and their most secret thoughts were open to review and scrutiny should any charge of unfairness or prejudice ever be brought against them.
</p>

<p>
The Never-First Schools always urged that the Judges should change from election to election and poll to poll, as did the members of the Parliament. The more traditional schools, however, always argued that, in order for law to be fair, reasonable men must be able to predict how it will be enforced, so as to be able to know what is and is not legal. Having sat on the bench for 7,400 years, the minds of the Curia were, like the approach of glaciers, like the ponderous motions of the outer planets, very predictable indeed.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
"My lawyer is Monomarchos of the Westmind Law-division.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, yes. Wait a moment while we open more channels and make arrangements: Monomarchos has a very high intellectual capacity, and we must reconfigure to permit that much active thought-space to enter this area.
</p>

<p>
Part of the wall behind Phaethon shimmered with heat. Nanomachines were constructing something with blinding speed. A silver cube, less than a yard across, slid out from the wall, glowing white hot. Phaethon’s armor protected him; Gannis had to step backward, his elbow up before his face.
</p>

<p>
A new voice spoke: “I am here.”
</p>

<p>
The white-hot cube spoke: “Phaethon, you may be unaware that you have already spent all ten thousand hours of computer time which you paid into my account. The accumulated interest on the time account has produced another forty-five seconds of thought time, which I am obligated to devote to your affairs; thereafter I shall be a free agent, and will take no further contracts from you. I have already deduced a method of allowing you to prevail, but I will use a different method, and achieve a different result, depending on whether you wish merely to prevail on this case, or to achieve those goals which the older version of you, the version whom you forget, the version who actually made me, preferred. Choose. You have thirty seconds left.”
