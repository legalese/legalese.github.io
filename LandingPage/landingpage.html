A bit of code that does all those things is what a smart contract actually is.

	  <h2>Even lawyers feel the pain</h2>
	  <p>Howard Darmstadter’s <a class="a-link" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25758526">Precision’s Counterfeit: The Failures of Complex Documents, and Some Suggested Remedies</a>, published in the American Bar Association’s <em>Business Lawyer</em> journal in 2010, reads like both a clarion call – “there’s got to be a better way!” – and a grope in the dark – “one possible idea: don’t repeat yourself” – by someone who, being a lawyer not a programmer, has no exposure to the disciplines and possibilities of software engineering and language design. Indeed, he talks about debugging contracts as programs; he talks about testing; he talks about using mathematical notation, even flowcharts, to improve clarity. But as a lawyer he doesn’t know where to go next with these ideas. Lawyers don’t get CLE credits for reading <a class="a-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Steve-McConnell/e/B000APETRK/">Steve McConnell</a>. Lawyers haven’t heard of <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming">language-oriented programming</a> or <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a>/<a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Modeling_Language">BPML</a>, whose history has much to teach. Yet contracts are, effectively, business process specifications, where they skip over the high-level modelling and go straight to writing a low-level runtime by hand … using a collaboration methodology that could only be described as <em>pair programming by correspondence</em>, the way <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Correspondence_Chess_Championship">chess used to be played</a> during the Cold War.</p>
	  <p>So, even lawyers are begging for this stuff. Who better to give it to them than us computer scientists? After all, we already invented <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>; we have a moral obligation to help them avoid reinventing our wheels.</p>
	  <p>Besides, programmers know very well the XY problem: “newbies ask how to do Y, when they really want to achieve X, but Y was the first thing that came to mind.” Darmstadter describes the problem without knowing its name when he suggests that contracts should try to specify <em>why</em> before implementing <em>how</em>. Darmstadter alludes to <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>, again without knowing its name, when he suggests that maybe contracts should include comments, or remarks, to help clarify the intent of a piece of code. The paper is a fun (and cringe-inducing) read.</p>
	  <p>Some legal thinkers <em>have</em> explored correspondences between law and software. These explorations are fruitful: in 2006 Henry Smith considered <a class="a-link" href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4050&amp;context=fss_papers">Modularity in Contracts: Boilerplate and Information Flow</a>. In 2016 Primavera de Filippi and Samer Hassan wrote <a class="a-link" href="http://www.firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7113">From code is law to law is code</a>.</p>
	  <p>Explorations into other correspondences will prove equally fruitful.</p>
	  <p>BigLawKM has an essay touching on some of these points: <a class="a-link" href="http://biglawkm.com/2016/10/25/smart-contracts-and-the-role-of-lawyers-part-3-about-lawyering-transactions-on-blockchains/">Smart Contracts and the Role of Lawyers</a>.

	  <h2>Turing-complete contracts</h2>
	  <p>The Legalese team has started work on L4, a (yet another) DSL for expressing regulations and contracts. This is a research project. Software eats law in a specific way: it gets <a class="a-link" href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/turingd/">Turing’d</a>, by way of a domain-specific language. (Lawyers, don’t worry; <a class="a-link" href="http://hodgen.com/questions-are-harder-than-answers/">you’ll keep your jobs</a>.)</p>
	  <p>The goal? To enable a lawyer – better yet, a non-lawyer – to draft a contract more concisely and clearly than they could in a natural language, by writing what looks like computer code. The drafter gets to take advantage of all sorts of ideas from computer science: variables, functions, third-party libraries, syntax and type checking, unit testing, completeness, and consistency. And the drafting community can get ideas from software engineering, like collaborative version control and opensource community support practices. The contract can be tested by fuzzing against future scenarios of breaches, possible legal challenges, and simulated courtrooms.</p>
	  <p>As Frederik Pohl might put it, <em>a good futurist predicts the car; a great futurist predicts the traffic jam.</em> If the car is a formal language for contracts and agreements (maybe even legislation), then a taxi service might be smart contracts integrated with cryptocurrencies and wholly automated business processes, exposed through legally binding APIs. The traffic jam? Maybe that’s a DDOS in the form of micro-contract spam, a welter of frivolous lawsuits, or a zero-day exploit of an error enshrined in some old piece of paperwork that didn’t get patched with the latest service pack.</p>
	  <p>Some initiatives are aligned with this vision:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Stanford’s <a class="a-link" href="http://compk.stanford.edu/">Computable Contracts Initiative</a></li>
	    <li>KWM Law has <a class="a-link" href="http://www.kwm.com/en/au/knowledge/insights/10-things-you-need-to-know-smart-contracts-20160630">good thought leadership</a> and even a Github repository showcasing <a class="a-link" href="https://github.com/KingandWoodMallesonsAU/Project-DnA">a pseudocode version</a> of a DSL.</li>

	  <h2>What is Legalese?</h2>
	  <p>Legalese is an open-source project to <i>draft legal documents the way programmers develop software</i>.  Just as <a class="a-link" href="https://www.cadence.com/">Cadence</a>'s Verilog allows programmers to draft circuits, Legalese's L4 language will allow programmers to draft contracts.  Our first product is <a class="a-link" href="https://legalese.com/docs">a SaaS app</a> for entrepreneurs to configure and engross <i>all</i> the paperwork for an angel or seed round — we're talking shareholders agreements, corporate resolutions and amendments, rights notices, as well as prerequisites like ESOPs and vesting, all compiled from high-level expressions.</p>
	  <h2>What is Legalese's vision?</h2>
	  <p>Law today is where software was in the late 1950s: getting ready to make the jump from macros to compiled languages. <a class="a-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrows-Lawyers-Introduction-Your-Future/dp/019966806X/">Tomorrow's lawyers</a> will look a lot like today's programmers: drawing on opensource libraries, they will configure code for clients that compiles to readable contracts – maybe English, maybe Ethereum/Hyperledger. From that future, we will look back on today's lawyers, drafting agreements in Microsoft Word and checking references mandraulically, as white-collar successors to <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)">John Henry</a>.</p>
	  <p>A “smart contracts” world needs Legalese more than ever, <a class="a-link" href="https://www.iif.com/publication/research-note/getting-smart-contracts-blockchain">Institute of International Finance (2016)</a> writes:</p>

	    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
	      <p>Because few lawyers have the coding skills to draft their own smart contracts, computer programmers would play a larger role, creating new liability questions for faulty algorithms and even ethical issues regarding the practice of law by non-lawyers. Conceivably, smart contracts could reduce some legal cost around contract execution and dispute resolution by making execution automatic. However, legal cost could shift from execution to the drafting phase. As Houman Shadab, a professor at New York Law School, has pointed out:</p>
	      <p><i>By requiring parties to strictly commit, at the outset, to decisions of a smart contract, the need for transactional attorneys and others to structure smart contractual relationships may increase. Parties would most likely want to specify a more detailed range of contingencies and outcomes ahead of time before committing themselves to abide by the decisions of a software-driven contract.</i></p>

      <div class="row">

	  <h2>Why choose Legalese?</h2>
	  <p>How does Legalese surpass existing approaches like <a class="a-link" href="https://www.clerky.com/">Clerky</a>, <a class="a-link" href="https://ironclad.ai/">Ironclad</a>, <a class="a-link" href="https://www.docracy.com/">Docracy</a>, <a class="a-link" href="https://github.com/commonform">Commonform</a>, and <a class="a-link" href="http://www.commonaccord.org/">CommonAccord</a>?</p>
	    <p>Such initiatives tend to run aground on the shoals of English: their “logic” is templates, stitched together the way PHP stitches together HTML. Taking a cue from commercial successes like ContractExpress which use deeper formalisms (Prolog), Legalese is developing a domain-specific language (DSL) from first principles. The DSL does for the <a class="a-link" href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-31570-1">deontic modal calculus</a> what functional languages do for the <a class="a-link" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363749">lambda calculus</a>. This solid foundation in CS theory enables the mapping of mature software concepts to the legal domain: compilation, dependency management, static analysis, and unit &amp; integration testing.</p>
	  <p>Formal semantics makes it possible to automate the production of <a class="a-link" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160703141747/http://www.tbrnet.org/blog/2014/08/01/legal-update-bilingual-contracts/">bilingual contracts</a> (think Quebec, Indonesia, China, EU, etc), using natural language generation tools that operate in the opposite direction to the current trend of natural language processing (<a class="a-link" href="https://www.judicata.com/">Judicata</a>, <a class="a-link" href="https://lexmachina.com/">Lex Machina</a>). Legalese will also automate the drafting of paperwork in the growing “self-help” segment currently served by LegalZoom. Eventually, Legalese may help states rewrite existing legislation and regulation in a formal grammar; such formalisms would make it much easier for companies like FiscalNote to achieve their goals.</p>
	  <h2>Why now?</h2>
	  <p>Thirty years of academic research in deontic modal logic, contract formalization, static analysis, and language design are coming to fruition in papers like <a class="a-link" href="http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/hvitved/publications/hvitved12phd.pdf">Tom Hvitved's PhD thesis (2013)</a>. Contracts are multiparadigmatic: they can be object-oriented, event-driven (reactive), functional, aspect-oriented, declarative, and imperative, all in the same document. Academic contract formalizations are just now beginning to satisfy the necessary properties for reduction to software practice.</p>

      <div class="row row-with-blockquote">
	<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	  <h2>Original Motivation</h2>
	  <p>How did we get the idea to represent contracts as code? Once upon a time, a programmer received an investment contract containing the following text:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not more than $32.5 Million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed valuation of $27.5 million.</p>
	    <p>If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at less than $40 million but not below $32.5 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of $35 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a valuation of 35M less 15% discount);</p>
	    <p>If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than $40 million but less than $47.06 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of $47.06 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a pre-money valuation of 40M i.e. $47.06 million less 15% discount);</p>
	    <p>If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than $47.06 million but less than $80 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of $40 million;</p>
	    <p>If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than $80M but less than $100M, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of $45M; and</p>
	    <p>If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than $100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of $50 million.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>Ten minutes and a strong cup of tea later, the notes in the margin read:</p>
	  <pre>
// why wasn't this just
if( seriesB < 32.5 ) { conversion = 27.5 }
   else if( seriesB < 40 ) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 }
           else if( seriesB < 47.06 ) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 } // then why the above line?
	           else if( seriesB < 80 ) { conversion = 40 }
			   else if( seriesB < 100 ) { conversion = 45 }
			           else { conversion = 50 }</pre>
	  <p>What if contracts could be written in a formal language first, and then compiled to natural language? A simple but powerful idea.  Imagine contracts in English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese – each translation provably identical to the others. Contracts amenable to <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">testing</a> and <a class="a-link" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160920-formal-verification-creates-hacker-proof-code/">formal methods</a>: <a class="a-link" href="http://spinroot.com/static/">static analysis</a> can prove that a contract is internally consistent, free of contradiction, and complete. Contracts that self-execute in software, integrated with business processes, interacting with other contracts. Contracts that easily afford illustrations, use cases, and scenarios, for end-users to reason concretely over. This vision has been expressed by <a class="a-link" href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/contractlanguage.html">Nick Szabo (2002)</a>, by <a class="a-link" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866">Harry Surden (2012)</a>, by <a class="a-link" href="https://financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-2015-04_Contract-as-Automaton-The-Computational-Representation-of-Financial-Agreements.pdf">Flood &amp; Goodenough (2014)</a>, by <a class="a-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5691">Camilleri, Paganelli, &amp; Schneider (2014)</a>, by <a class="a-link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-72952-5_11">Prisacariu &amp; Schneider (2007)</a>.</p>
