      <h2>Hello! We are so chuffed to have you with us.</h2>
      <p>These Terms (as defined in detail below) describe your

      <p>The Products are provided by Legalese Pte. Ltd. (also
	referred to as “<b>Legalese</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>”
	or “<b>us</b>”), a private limited company incorporated in Singapore with the unique entity

      <h2>First things first</h2>
      <h3>What 'These Terms' include</h3>
      <p><a class="footnote">This document <span>i.e. these Terms
	    of Use, as may be amended from time to time</span></a> is to be read and interpreted together
	with, where applicable, our <a class="a-link"
				       href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and any additional
	terms, policies, and requirements that we may provide from
	time to time (all of which together with these Terms of Use,
	collectively referred to as these
	“<b>Terms</b>”).</p>
      <h3>Navigating this document</h3>
      <ul>
	<li><a class="footnote">Highlighted texts like this (go on, you
	    can click it)<span>Good job, you clicked something.</span></a>
	  are clickable –– when clicked, they display further information
	  (they're a bit like footnotes), all of which are incorporated as
	  part of these Terms.</li>
	<li>Capitalised terms not otherwise defined under
	  these Terms will bear the same meaning
	  as that ascribed to them under the <a class="a-link"
						href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> (as may be
	  amended from time to time).</li></ul>

      <h3>These Terms form part of a binding contract</h3>
      <p>These Terms describe your rights and responsibilities,
	and govern your access and use of any or all of the
	Products, including any services or features we offer
	through it.</p>
      <p>We know it can be a bit of a chore (as these things
	usually are), but please do read these Terms carefully as
	your agreement to be bound by these Terms is a condition
	for using or accessing any of the Products.</p>
      <p><b>In fact, by using or accessing any of the Products,
	  you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms.</b></p>
      <p>In other words, these Terms form a binding agreement
	between you and Legalese.</p>
      <p>If you are not eligible to use or access the Products
	under these Terms, or if you do not agree to these Terms,
	then you do not have our permission to use or access the
	Products (or any part thereof).</p>

      <h3>'We' may include the extended team</h3>
      <p>We may leverage our employees, contributors, third party
	contractors, and such of those of our corporate affiliates
	(all of whom together, the "<a class="footnote"><b>Extended
	    Team</b><span>We call them the Extended Team and not a
	    “family” because we read the HBR 2014 piece, <em>Your
	      Company Is Not A Family</em></span></a>") in exercising our
	rights and performing our obligations, whether directly or
	indirectly, in respect of the Products. While to the extent
	reasonably practicable, we will be responsible for the
	Extended Team’s compliance with our obligations under these
	Terms, where we leverage the Extended Team (whether directly
	or indirectly) in exercising our rights or performing our
	obligations in respect of the Products, you acknowledge and
	accept that these Terms shall extend to and cover the
	Extended Team as applicable, and where applicable,
	references to “<b>Legalese</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>”
	or “<b>us</b>” in these Terms shall therefore also included the
	Extended Team.

	<h3>Who ‘you’ are</h3>
      <p>You are the individual using and/or accessing the
	Products.</p>

      <h4>If you're a representative</h4><br>
      <p>You are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of
	whomever (whether individual, company, organisation, or
	entity) you are accessing or using the Products for. As
	such, please make sure that you have the necessary authority
	to enter into and agree to these Terms on such  behalf before
	proceeding.</p>

      <h4>Corporate email domain</h4><br>
      <p>If you are signed up for an account on the Products using
	a corporate email domain, "<b>you</b>” means that entity
	owning that corporate email domain used to sign up for an
	account. This means that such entity is entitled to modify,
	re-assign roles, or otherwise exercise any applicable rights
	under these Terms.</p>

      <br> 
      <h2>Using the Products</h2>
      <h4>Follow our instructions as intended, and no misconduct
	or misuse please! </h4>
      <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with
	these Terms, Legalese grants you a limited, non-transferable,
	non-sublicensable, revocable permission to access and/or use
	the Products for your personal, internal use during the Term
	at the level of service for which you have paid all
	applicable fees.</p>
      <p>You must ensure that you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account
	(“<b>Authorised Users</b>”) fully comply with these
	Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we
	have no obligation to do so.</p>

        <h3>We are not lawyers, legal, investment, accounting, tax, or financial advisors</h3>
      <p><b>Legalese is a technology company</b>. We are not a law firm, are not engaged in a legal practice, and do not perform the services of a law firm or a solicitor. Accordingly,
     we do not give legal advice and cannot represent you. The Products are not intended (and shall not be used) as a substitute for legal, accounting, tax, investment, or other professional advice or services.</p>
      <p>We aim to provide information and access to industry standards,
	received industry advice, open-source, third party and
	proprietary documents and tutorials, templated forms,
	analytics and data, team administration and networking
	functionality, cap table modelling, value-added
	document-related services, and additional features to assist
	with the completion of tasks and workflows relating to you,
	your company and/or its administration.</p>
      <p>While we strive to give you as many practical options as possible when generating and modifying the documents in the workflow, we cannot cover all possible situations. As such, we cannot guarantee that documents created will fit all circumstances. We also cannot guarantee that documents generated (including situations where documents are generated with your input, information pulled from third parties, or with any offline changes you have made) will be legally sound or free from liabilities.</p> 
      <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for the
	appropriate use of any documents, instructions, tutorials or
	data downloaded, obtained from, or otherwise sourced in whole
	or in part from us or the Products. In particular you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>There is no solicitor–client relationship between you and Legalese, or any party who provided the templates.</li> 
	<li>Legalese is not providing legal, financial, accounting, tax, investment
	   or any other professional advice. The Products should not be
	  used as a substitute for advice from qualified legal, investment, tax
	  or accounting professionals.</li>
	<li>The documents available via the Products may not fit
	  your specific circumstances. You should make your own
	  judgement on the suitability of any such materials to your
	  circumstances, or obtain your own legal advice to review
	  such materials before using them.</li>
	<li>Legalese cannot and does not provide any assurance or
	  guarantee that any documents provided via the Products are
	  suitable, sufficient, correct, or appropriate for the use to which
	  you put them.</li>
	<li>Legalese is excluded from all legal responsibility
	  and/or costs for reliance placed by anyone on the
	  Products, or any information, documents, or logic obtained
	  therefrom.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>General rules</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The Products are not intended for and should not be
	  used by anyone under the age of 18.</li>
	<li>You and your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> must follow any policies
	  made available to you within or via the Products.</li>
	<li>You and your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> must not misuse our
	  Products.<br><em>For example, you and your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> must not interfere with the Products (or our
	    provision of them), interfere with or circumvent any
	    feature of the Product(s), and further must not try
	    accessing them using a method other than via the interface
	    and instructions that we provide. This includes any
	    technological measures we employ to enforce these
	    Terms.</em></li>
	<li>You and your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> must not use our
	  Products where it is prohibited by laws applicable
	  (whether to you or us), including any export and re-export
	  control laws and regulations that may apply.</li>
	<li>You and your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> must not use the
	  Products in a way that infringes anyone’s rights.</li>
	<li>Using the Products does not give you or your
	  <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> any ownership of any intellectual
	  property rights in the Products or any content or features
	  accessed therein.</li>
	<li>You will also keep your billing and
	  contact information current at all times by notifying
	  Legalese of any changes.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Non-Legalese Stuff You May Encounter</h3>
      <p>Our Products may from time to time include platforms that
	third parties may use to develop applications and software
	that complement the use of the Product(s), or content
	sourced from third parties that we have no legal
	relationship with or have no control over (“<b>Non-Legalese
	  Stuff</b>”). Non-Legalese Stuff are not the Products, and we
	do not warrant or support them. Ultimately, it is up to you
	(not us) that decides whether or not to use them or heed
	them.</p>

      <h3>Beta Products</h3>
      <p>Occasionally, we may release Product(s) and features on a
	alpha, beta, seed, and other pre-release basis, and related
	documentation, materials, and information (collectively, the
	"<b>Beta Products</b>".</p>
      <p>Beta Products will be identified as “<em>beta</em>” or
	“<em>pre-release</em>”, or with words or phrases importing
	similar meanings.</p>
      <p>Beta Products are not ready for prime time, and any
	warranties or contractual commitments that we may make for
	other Products do not apply.</p>
      <p>We expect Beta Products to contain defects and bugs. Beta
	Products are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis
	for the sole purpose of providing Legalese with feedback on
	quality, usability, performance, and the idenitification of
	defects.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Modifying Products</h2>
      <p>We are constantly changing and improving. We may add or
	remove functionalities, features, or even entire Product(s)
	altogether. We may also stop providing Products to you, or
	add or create new limits to our Product(s) at any time. We
	also reserve the right to charge for any of our Product(s),
	features, or functionalities at any time.</p>
      <p>Subject to these Terms and any payment obligations you
	may have already incurred, you can stop using the Products
	at any time, although we’d be rather sorry to see you
	go.</p>

      <br>  <h2>Send us feedback</h2>
      <p>We welcome feedback. When you send us feedback or
	suggestions regarding us or any of the Products, there is a
	chance that we will use it. Please note that if you send us
	any feedback or suggestions, they will likely not be kept
	confidential. Along with any feedback or suggestions, you
	also grant us (for Legalese, and all of our users,
	customers, or any personnel of ours) an unlimited,
	unrestricted, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual,
	sublicensable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, transferable,
	royalty-free right to use and exploit any such feedback or
	suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or
	compensation to you. However, if we for whatever reason
	choose not to implement a suggestion or feedback, please
	know that we appreciate it nonetheless.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>User Data</h2>
      <p>You or your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> may upload, submit, store,
	send or receive content or information (including any
	confidential company or personal data) as part of your use
	and/or access of the Products (“<b>User Data</b>”) and you
	may exclusively provide us with instructions (at the time of
	disclosure) on what to do with it.<br><em>For example, you
	  may provision or deprovision access to the Products, enable
	  or disable third party integrations, manage permissions,
	  retention, and export settings, transfer or assign
	   <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a>, share information with external parties,
	  consolidate information, etc.</em><br>Since these choices by
	and instructions from you and/or your <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> may
	result in the access, use, disclosure, modification, or
	deletion of certain or all User Data, please consider your
	instructions carefully and be familiar with
	our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy
	  Policy</a>.</p>

      <h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
      <p>It is your responsibility to (a) inform all <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> of your own policies and practices, and applicable
	laws and/or regulations that are relevant to their use of
	the Products, and of any settings and interaction that may
	impact the processing of User Data; and (b) obtain all
	rights, permissions, or consents from Authorised Users or
	such other persons that are necessary to grant the rights
	and licenses under these Terms and for the lawful use and
	transmission of User Data and the operation and use of the
	Products.</p>

      <h3>How we treat User Data</h3>
      <p>Your User Data is uploaded and downloaded over a secure
	connection, your credentials are encrypted and hashed. We
	don’t store (or even know) your password. Your User Data is
	stored securely, and only people you’ve given express
	account access to can access your User Data (and even then,
	only to the extent of the access permissions set by you
	under your account). We expect you to ensure that your team,
	particularly those you give Admin access to, have strong and
	unqiue passwords.</p>
      <p>For more information about how we treat your User Data,
	and also other kinds of data we collect, read our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html"
							     target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <p>We think it’s pretty common sense but we’ll say it
	anyway: if we, in our sole and absolute discretion,
	determine that you have acted inappropriately, we reserve
	the right to take down User Data, terminate your account,
	prohibit you from using the Products, and take any legal action
	that we may deem fit.</p>

      <h3>Protecting User Data</h3>
      <p>The protection of User Data is a top priority for us.
	We will strive to  maintain administrative, physical, and technical
	safeguards at a level not materially less protective than our own Security Policy. Those safeguards
	will include measures for preventing unauthorized access,
	use, modification, deletion and disclosure of User Data by
	our personnel. Before sharing User Data with any of our
	third party service providers, we will ensure that the third
	party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for
	maintaining the confidentiality and security of User Data
	and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
      <p>However, ultimately, you (not us) bear sole
	responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup
	of User Data when in your or your representatives’ or
	agents’ possession or control or when you choose to use
	unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to
	the Products. We are not responsible for what your
	 <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> do with User
	Data; that is your responsibility.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Ownership of information & proprietary rights</h2>
      <h3>General rule</h3>
      <p>You are prohibited from using proprietary content from or in
	the Products for purposes other than that which they have been
	provided for under the Products, unless you have obtained
	the requisite permission from its owner.</p>

      <h3>What’s yours is yours</h3>
      <p>As between us on one hand, and you and your Authorised
	Users on the other, you will retain ownership of any
	intellectual property rights that you hold in User Data, and
	all confidentiality rights in confidential data.</p>
      <p>Subject to these Terms, you (for yourself and all of your
	 <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a>) grant us and the Extended Team, a
	worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, limited license to
	access, use, host, encode, store, reproduce, process,
	modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting
	from translations, adaptations, or other changes we make so
	that your User Data works better with the Products),
	distribute, communicate, export, publish, publicly perform,
	and display User Data, and any Non-Legalese Stuff created by
	or for you, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide,
	maintain, operate, promote, or improve the Products (or to
	develop new ones); (b) to prevent or address service,
	security, product, support, or technical issues in any of
	the Products; and (c) as required by applicable law and/or
	regulations, or as permitted by our <a class="a-link"
					       href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. You
	represent and warrant to us that you have secured all rights
	in and to User Data from your  <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> as may be
	necessary to submit User Data and grant this license. This
	license continues even if you stop using the Products,
	although some Products may offer you ways to access, remove,
	or limit the use of User Data that you had provided.</p>
      <p>You also agree to indemnify, release, and hold us
	harmless from all liability, claims, actions, loss, harm,
	damage, injury, cost, or expense arising out of any User
	Data.</p>
      <p>We may also employ automated systems to analyse your User
	Data to provide you personally relevant Product
	features.</p>

      <h3>What’s others’ is theirs</h3>
      <p>The Products may from time to time display content that
	is not ours. Such content remains their rightful owners'. For the avoidance
	of doubt, we make no representations, warranties, or
	endorsements as to the accuracy, completeness, relevance, or
	truth of such content. Accordingly, we cannot be held
	liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage you
	suffer in connection with any content that is not
	ours.</p>

      <h3>What’s ours is ours</h3>
      <p>Using the Products does not give you ownership or any
	proprietary or intellectual property rights in the Products
	or the content that you access.

	<h3>Other restrictions</h3>
      <p>These Terms also do not grant you the right to use any
	branding or logos used in the Products. You are also
	prohibited from removing, obscuring, or altering any notices
	or disclaimers displayed in or along with the Products.</p>
      <p>As an open source company, open source software is even
	more important to us. Some software used in our products
	may be offered under an open source license that we will
	make available to you. There may be provisions in the open
	source license that expressly oveerride some of these
	Terms, in such event, the express terms of such open source
	licenses that override these Terms will prevail (but only
	to the extent applicable to the open source content and/or
	elements to which they relate).</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Privacy & copyright protection</h2>
      <p>Our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy
	  Policy</a> explains how we treat information, your personal data and
	protect your privacy when you use the Products. By using the
	Products, you agree that we can use such data in accordance
	with our privacy policies.</p>
      <p>We may choose to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement.</p>
      <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect you to do the same.</p>
      <p>If you have an intellectual-property rights related
	complaint about material posted on or distributed through the Products, please
	write to us at <a class="a-link"

      </ul>

      <br>
      <h2>Your purchasing decisions</h2>
      <p>We may from time to time share information about our
	future products, plans, features, and functionalities
	(“<b>Possible Futures</b>”) because we relish the
	transparency and openness. However, please do not rely on
	our public statements about any Possible Futures when making
	a commitment or purchase with us. Should you decide to buy
	the Products or pay for any of them, that decision should be
	based on the functionalities or features that we have made
	available today and not on any expectation of delivery of
	any Possible Futures. Please take us as we are.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Your payment obligations (if any)</h2>
      <h3>Payment terms</h3>
      <p>Fees and payment obligations for any of the Products may
	be set out to you in the user interface, as
	appropriate. Payment obligations are non-cancellable and,
	except as expressly stated by us in written terms, fees paid
	are non-refundable.</p>
      <p>For clarity, in the event that you downgrade any subscriptions
	from a paid plan to a free plan, you will remain responsible
	for any unpaid fees already accrued under the paid plan, and Products under
	the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered
	upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription
	term.</p>

      <p>If we agree to invoice you by email, full payment must be
	received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Fees
	are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or
	similar governmental assessments of any nature, including,
	for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes,
	assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively,
	“<b>Taxes</b>”). You will be responsible for paying all
	Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes
	based on our net income.</p>

      <h3>Credits</h3>
      <p>Any credits that may accrue to your account (for example,
	from a promotion or given by us at our sole and absolute
	discretion), will expire following the expiration date as
	applicable (usually made known at the same time as when the
	credit was first made known to you), will have no currency or
	exchange value, and will not be transferable or
	refundable. Credits accrued to a team on a free subscription
	plan will expire if the team’s plan is not upgraded to a
	paid plan within one-hundred and eighty (180) days of
	accrual.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Our responsibilities</h2>
      <h3>Providing the Products</h3>
      <p>You’re not the only one with responsibilities; we have
	some, too.<br>We will, subject to these Terms, use our best
	efforts to (a) make the Product(s) available.</p>
      <p>Be assured that unless arising out of
	the <em>Non-Legalese Stuff</em> section, due to any breach
	of these Terms on your part, or circumstances not within our
	control, we will use our best efforts to not materially
	decrease the functionality of the Product(s) during your
	applicable subscription term. For any breach of a warranty
	in this section, your exclusive remedies are those described
	in these Terms, and your payments or subscription terms, as relevant.</p>
      <h3>Keeping the Products available</h3>
      <p>For some of the Products (excluding Beta Products), we may offer specific uptime
	commitments paired with credits for the event if we fall
	short. In those cases, the credits will serve as what the
	lawyers call ‘liquidated damages’ and will be your sole
	remedy for the downtime and related inconvenience. For all
	Products (excluding Beta Products), we will use commercially
	reasonable efforts to make them available 24 hours a day, 7
	days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned
	downtime to be infrequent but will endeavor to provide you
	with advance notice (e.g., through the relevant Product(s)),
	if we think it may exceed thirty (30) continuous minutes.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Electronic communications</h2>
      <p>When you use the Products or send communications to us
	via any of the Products, you are communicating with us
	electronically. You also consent to receive electronically
	any communications related to your use of the Products. We
	may communicate with you by email or by posting notices on
	the Product. You agree that all agreements, notices,
	disclosures and other communications that are provided to
	you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
	communications be in writing. All notices from us intended
	for receipt by you shall be deemed delivered and effective
	when sent to the email address you provide to us. Please
	note that by submitting User Data, creating a user account
	or otherwise providing us with your email address, postal
	address or phone number, you are agreeing that we or our
	agents may contact you at that address or number in a manner
	consistent with our <a class="a-link"
			       href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Warranties & disclaimers</h2>
      <p>We provide the Products (save for the Beta Products,
	which are provided on a much lower, diminished, and
	compromised standard) using a commercially reasonable level
	of skill and care as that expected of service providers, and
	we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are
	certain things that we don’t and cannot promise about the
	Products.</p>

      <h3>No specific promises</h3>
      <p>Save where expressly set out in these Terms or additional
	terms that you may have with us, neither Legalese nor its
	Extended Team, makes any specific promises about the
	Products or any part thereof. For example, we don’t make any
	commitments about the content within the Products, the
	specific function of the Product(s), or their reliability,
	enforceability, availability, correctness, fitness for any
	particular purpose, or their ability to meet your needs. The
	Products are provided on an as-is and as-available
	basis.</p>
      <h3>No implied terms</h3>
      <p>Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like
	the implied warranties of merchantability, title, fitness
	for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. To the
	extent permitted by applicable law, we hereby exclude all
	warranties.  You further acknowledge and accept that we do
	not warrant that the Products will be uninterrupted, timely,
	secure, or error-free.</p>

      <h3>Liability</h3>
      <p>To the extent not prohibited by applicable law and/or
	regulations, Legalese and its Extended Team will not be
	responsible for any lost profits, revenues, investment,
	data, financial losses, opportunity costs, direct damages
	(i.e. damages that one would reasonably expect to arise from
	any breach in question, without taking into account any
	special circumstances of the non-breaching party),
	incidental damages (i.e. expenses incurred by the
	non-breaching party in connection with its rejection of the
	Products, or by the non-breaching Party in connection with
	an alleged breach), consequential damages (i.e. losses
	sustained by the non-breaching party that are attributable
	to any special circumstances of such party that the
	allegedly breaching party was aware of when the
	non-breaching party used the relevant Product(s)), exemplary
	or punitive damages.</p>
      <p>Other than in connection with a party’s indemnification
	obligations hereunder, in no event will either Legalese or
	the Extended Team’s aggregate liability arising out of or
	related to the Terms or any other applicable terms (whether
	in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability)
	exceed the total amount paid by you in respect of the
	relevant subscription and/or Product in the twelve (12)
	months preceding the last event giving rise to
	the alleged liability. The foregoing will not limit your payment
	obligations set out in these Terms or any other applicable
	terms.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for all login credentials, including
	usernames and passwords, for administrator accounts as well
	the accounts of your  <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a>. We will not be
	responsible for any damages, losses or liability to you,
	 <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a>, or anyone else, if such information is not
	kept confidential by you or your  <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a>, or if
	such information is correctly provided by an unauthorized
	third party logging into and accessing the services.</p>
      <p>The limitations under this Liability section applies with
	respect to all legal theories, whether in contract, tort or
	otherwise, and to the extent permitted by law. The
	provisions of this Liability section allocate the risks
	between the parties under these Terms, and the parties have
	relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter
	into a contract for Products, subscriptions, and the pricing
	for the Products (or any part thereof).</p>
      <p>You agree, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
	law, to hold harmless and indemnify Legalese and the Extended
	Team, including each of Legalese’s and the Extended Team’s
	affiliates, officers, agents, contractors, and employees
	from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to
	the use of the Products or violation of these Terms,
	including any liability or expense arising from claims,
	losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and
	attorneys’ fees.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Term</h2>
      <p>These Terms are effective the earliest of, the date on
	which you first accept these Terms, and the date on which
	you first download, install, access, or use the Products
	(the "<b>Commencement Date</b>")</p>
      <p>The "<b>Term</b>" of these Terms means: (a) in respect of
	free subscriptions, the period from the Commencement Date
	until so terminated in accordance with these Term; and (b)
	in respect of a paid subscription or paid element of the
	Product, the period from the Commencement Date until such
	subscription plan or paid element expire on its terms or is
	otherwise terminated in accordance with these Terms.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <h3>Termination for cause</h3>
      <p>Either of us may terminate these Terms on notice to the
	other party if the other party materially breaches these Terms
	and such breach (provided that such breach is capable of
	being corrected) is not cured within thirty (30) days after
	the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach.</p>
      <p>You are fully responsible for your  <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a>,
	including for any breaches of these Terms caused by your
	Authorized Users. We may terminate these Terms or any
	relationship with you immediately on notice to you if we
	reasonably believe that the Products are being used by you
	or your  <a class="footnote">Authorised Users<span>you and anyone you give access to
	and/or authorise to use the Products in your account</span></a> in violation of applicable law.</p>

      <h3>Effect of termination</h3>
      <p>Upon any termination for cause by you, we will refund you

      <p>Upon any termination for cause by us, you will pay any
	unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Term of those
	subscriptions after the effective date of termination. In no
	event will any termination relieve you of the obligation to
	pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the
	effective date of termination.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Data portability & deletion</h2>
      <p>During your use of the Product or during the term of a
	subscription with us, you may be permitted to export or
	share certain User Data from the Products; provided, however,
	that because we have different products with varying
	features and you have different retention options, you
	acknowledge and agree that the ability to export or share
	User Data may be limited or unavailable depending on the
	type of Product plan in effect and the data retention,
	sharing or invite settings enabled. Following termination or
	expiration of your subscription, we will have no obligation
	to maintain or provide any User Data and may thereafter,
	unless legally prohibited, delete all User Data in our
	systems or otherwise in our possession or under our
	control.</p>


      <br>

	our existing or potential customers, subject to your
	standard trademark usage guidelines as provided to us from

      <h2>About these Terms</h2>
      <br><h4>Force Majeure</h4>
      <p>Neither of us will be liable by reason of any failure or
	delay in the performance of its obligations on account of
	events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may
	include denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third
	party hosting provider or utility provider, strikes,
	shortages, riots, fires, acts of god, war, terrorism, and
	governmental action.</p>
      <br><h4>Modifications</h4>
      <p>We may modify these Terms or any additional terms that
	apply to the Products to, for example, reflect changes to
	the law or changes to the Products. You should look at these
	Terms regularly as we will post notice of modifications to
	these Terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified
	additional terms in the applicable Product(s). Changes will
	not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner
	than fourteen days after they are posted, but where such
	changes address new functions for a Product or are made for
	legal reasons, such changes shall be effective
	immediately. If you do not agree to any modified terms, you
	must discontinue your use and access of the Products immediately.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Governing law & dispute resolution</h4>
      <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance
	with the laws of the Republic of Singapore without regard to
	the principles of conflict of laws. In relation to any legal
	action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with
	these Terms (including the validity of these Terms), you and
	Legalese hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
	the Courts of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Precedence</h4>
      <p>If there is a conflict between these Terms and the
	additional terms, the additional terms shall prevail to the
	extent that any such conflict occurs.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Severance</h4>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms or part thereof is
	rendered void, illegal, or unenforceable by any applicable
	laws and/or regulations to which it is subject, it shall be
	rendered void, illegal, or unenforceable to that extent and
	no further.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>No third party beneficiaries</h4>
      <p>These Terms control the relationship between Legalese and
	you, and do not create any third party beneficiary
	rights. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
	(Cap. 53B) of Singapore (and any statutory equivalent where applicable) shall
	not under any circumstances apply to these Terms, and any
	person who is not a party to these Terms (whether or not
	such person shall be named, referred to, or otherwise
	identified, or form part of a class of persons so named,
	referred to or identified, in these Terms) shall have no
	right whatsoever under the Contracts (Rights of Third
	Parties) Act (Cap. 53B) of Singapore to enforce these Terms
	or any of its provisions.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Assignment</h4>
      <p>You shall
	not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations
	under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without
	our prior written consent.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing in this <em>Assignment</em>
	section, either of us may assign these Terms in its
	entirety, without consent of the other party, to a corporate
	affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
	corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially
	all of its assets. Any purported assignment in
	violation of this section is void. A party’s sole remedy for
	any purported assignment by the other party in breach of
	this section on <em> Assignment</em> will be, at the non-assigning party’s election,
	termination of these Terms upon written notice to the
	assigning party. In the event of such a termination by you,
	we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder
	of the relevant Term of all subscriptions after the effective date of
	termination. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind
	and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective
	successors and permitted assigns.</p>

      <br><h4>Non-waiver</h4>
      <p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don’t take
	action right away, this does not mean that we are giving up
	any rights that we may have, and this will not preclude us
	from taking any action in the future. Any single or partial
	exercise of any right under these Terms shall also not
	preclude any other or further exercise of it.</p>
