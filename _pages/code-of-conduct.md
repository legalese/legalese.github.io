> "You know, when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices," Finkle-McGraw said. "It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of climate, you are not allowed to criticise others — after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?"
>
> "Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done."
>
> "We take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy," Finkle-McGraw continued. "In the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite was someone who espoused high moral views as part of a planned campaign of deception — he never held these beliefs sincerely and routinely violated them in privacy. Of course, most hypocrites are not like that. Most of the time it's a spirit-is-willing, flesh-is-weak sort of thing."
>
> "That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code."

# Code of Conduct (also our culture keys)

We care about intelligent and nuanced [discourse](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) and [moral reflection as a public endeavour](http://www.conversationsonphilanthropy.org/book-review/justice-whats-the-right-thing-to-do/).

We want to encourage (and empower) people to be competent, playful, honest, integrous, curious, empathetic, thriving, silly, engaged, and excited. Let's build an environment and community that fosters that.

## Living and Working in Relation to Other People

We want to hire and reward [fully formed adults](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr).

We really like Netflix's expression of their culture keys ([will you just look at this beauty and the footnotes!](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)), so we take inspiration on that and clarify what "being a fully formed adult" means to us:

### Judgement

- Making wise decisions in the circumstances (despite ambiguity) — we cannot stress the [Cynefin framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) enough
- Identifying root causes, and getting beyond treating symptoms; of course, if something's urgent, fix the Code Blue and mark the root cause (or investigation of it) as a TO-DO
- Thinking strategically and then articulating what you *are* trying to do as well as what you *are not* trying to do
- Just generally relying on your logic and common sense (we respect using data judiciously to inform intuition)
- Knowing when & how to ask for help; also related to being able to effectively and objectively evaluate your own abilities

### Communication

- Being [clear and articulate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17855868) in speech & writing
- Using proper grammar & spelling, where contextually significant
- Clearly communicating needs, boundaries, expectations, and feelings
- Providing timely, honest, helpful, and direct feedback, but remember to [RadicalCandor-it](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)
- Listening well & seeking to understand before reacting
- Signposting early & often
- Giving adequate & at least all necessary information that can help others help you
- Communication fidelity; but again signposting if things change or you've changed

### Responsibility

- [Everyone sweeps the floor](http://jnack.com/blog/2017/08/28/everyone-sweeps-the-floor-around-here-wisdom-from-adobes-founders/)
- Searching for duplicates before posting
- [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)
- Encountered a problem and then fixed it like a champ? Thank you very much, but also please UpdateTFM
- Being respectful of others' time, resources, and opportunity costs

### Emotional & Intellectual Maturity

- Taking smart risks & being open to possible failure
- Intervening if someone is being marginalised or treated unfairly
- Minimising complexity & finding time to simplify
- Recognising & accepting your own feelings & needs (but also that your feelings don't run the show)
- Treating people with respect independent of their status or disagreement with you
- Don't take it personally; [don't make it personal](https://medium.com/@krisgage/15-signs-of-emotional-maturity-38b1a2ab9766)
- Recognising that we all have biases, and work to grow past them
- Challenge prevailing assumptions and suggest better approaches
- Seeking alternate perspectives; but also [disagree and commit](https://hackernoon.com/disagree-and-commit-the-importance-of-disagreement-in-decision-making-b31d1b5f1bdc)

## Committed To Intelligent & Nuanced Discourse

We think about:
- [How to Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)
- [The Culture of Shut Up](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/the-culture-of-shut-up/360239/)

- [Moral Foundations Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_foundations_theory)
- [Conflict vs Mistake](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/7su7yl/conflict_vs_mistake/)

## Zero Tolerance of Harassment

We are committed to being a harassment-free organisation and community based on treating everyone — cofounders, contributors, staff, customers, volunteers, sponsors, partners, members of the public — with [radical candour](https://www.radicalcandor.com/about-radical-candor/) (as opposed to ruinous empathy, manipulative insincerity, or obnoxious aggression). Please be excellent to but honest with each other.

Harassment is not tolerated. Harassment includes (but is not limited to):

- Verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, marital status, body size, sexual orientation, age, physical ability or appearance, ethnicity, race, or religious beliefs (or lack thereof)
- Deliberate intimidation
- Unwelcome and irrelevant comments regarding a person's lifestyle, choices, or practices
- Stalking
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption or hijacking of discussions and/or events
- Non-adherence to the boundaries established or communicated by other members and/or moderators
- Threats of violence
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to self-harm
- Continued one-on-one communication after a request to cease
- Physical contact (including simulated physical contact, for example, textual descriptions like *backrub*) or sexual attention, without consent or after a request to stop
- Inappropriate and/or unwelcome personal attention

Our zero-tolerance policy on harassment means that we will look into, investigate, and review every allegation of violation of our Code of Conduct and respond appropriately. We are committed to due process, justice, integrity, constructive engagement of differences, accountability, and transparency.

### Reporting harassment

We take harassment very seriously. Please report any kind of harassment or suspicions of harassment to us at [collective@legalese.com](mailto:collective@legalese.com?subject=Reporting%20Harassment) or to Alexis personally at [alexis@legalese.com](mailto:alexis@legalese.com?subject=Reporting%20Harassment).

### Violations

Anyone who is found to be in violation may be handled in one or more of these methods:
- Warning (public or otherwise)
- Expulsion
- Contacting of the police
- Actions stronger than a warning that may also be taken at the discretion of two or more board members

Malicious or reckless false reporting will also be treated harshly. Personal disputes should be handled privately, unless actual harassment occurs.

We reserve the right to prohibit or limit the participation of anyone found in violation of our Code of Conduct. We believe in second chances and learning from mistakes / missteps, but we also know that some battles are better fought elsewhere, and some wounds deserving of strong intervention.

## Drugs & Alcohol

Remember that bit about **fully formed adults**? Sure you do. So please, do use your good judgment and never use drugs and/or alcohol in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behaviour, endangers the safety of yourself or others, or violates the law.

## Conflicts of Interest

When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for you, your friends, your partner(s), or your family at the expense of Legalese or our users, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. This is mostly for people compensated by Legalese, but we also think it would be a rather good standard operating procedure for life: avoid conflicts of interest if you can, but if you can't, identify it, address it, and mitigate it with a clear head and good faith.

## Confidential Information

Don't disclose confidential (i.e. non public) information without first asking for permission. This works both ways. It's utterly ingratiating and sycophantic to share others' secrets and confidential info with us without their permission — don't be that person. Fight fair. People don't just wake up one day and decide to be the villain, it happens by a thousand tiny surrenders of self-respect to self-interest.
