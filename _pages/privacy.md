## Hello! We are so chuffed to have you with us.

This Privacy Policy applies to our website, web applications, platform, services, community / developer resources, and products as provided at [legalese.com](https://legalese.com) (each a "**Product**", and collectively, the "**Products**").

There are many ways that you can use our Products. We understand and appreciate that when you use our Products you may share information with us. Sharing your information may help us make our Products even better – for instance, to show you more relevant search results, to show you more appropriate smart defaults, to make sharing with others quicker and easier, etc.

That said, your privacy and preferences are important to us. Whether you are new to us or a long-time user, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:support@legalese.com) should you have any questions.

## First things first

### Read this with the terms of use

This Privacy Policy complements our [Terms of Use](/terms). This means they are to be read together. We urge you to also familiarise yourself with both of them and all other documents that they may reference.

This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what information we collect, how we might use it, and what choices you have with regard such information.

**By using our Product(s), you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set out in this Privacy Policy.**

## Information that we collect

We collect information in a bid to better understand our Products and users (like you) so that we may then provide better Products and user experiences.

We collect the following kind of information:

### Information you give us

This could be Personal Data (data that personally identifies a single person, such as your name, email address, or credit card details) or non-personal information. You may be asked to provide such information anytime you are in contact with Legalese or using any of the Products.

For example:
- Our Products may require you to sign up for an account with us in order to unlock or use certain features or functionalities. When you do sign up for an account, we'll ask for Personal Data such as your contact details, address, and name to store with your account.
- We may use Personal Data of your family, friends, associates, or such other relevant persons as you may elect and inform us of, in order for us to fulfill your requests and instructions.
- We may use Personal Data that you give us (including date of birth) to verify identity, assist with the identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.
- We may from time to time use your Personal Data to send important notices (such as communications about purchases and changes to our Terms of Use, conditions, and policies).
- We may use Personal Data for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our Products and customer communications.

### Information we get from your use of Products

We collect information about the Products that you use and how you use them. This includes information like your data usage, preferences, selection, interaction with our Products, browsing history, searches, documents, and other content hosted by us or on our behalf.

Such information includes:
- **Device information**: information specific to the device you used to access the Product(s), such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
- **Log information**: information automatically collected and stored in server logs, including details of how you used our Products, internet protocol address, device event information, browser type, browser language, date and time of your usage, and cookies.
- **Location information**: information about your actual location when you use our Products, determined through various technologies including IP address and GPS.
- **Information in local storage**: information collected and stored locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.
- **Information from cookies & similar technologies**: information obtained from technologies used to identify the browser or device which you used to visit or use a Product.

## How we use information that we collect

If you do not want us to use your information in any of the way(s) described in this Privacy Policy, please [let us know immediately](mailto:support@legalese.com).

We use the information that we collect so that we can provide the Products to you and enhance your experience of the Products. We may also personalize your repeat visits in a bid to make the process more seamless and tailored to your needs. We may use your Personal Data to contact you and, if you agree, to enable our affiliates or partners to contact you.

### According to your account preferences

Information you post or share on or via our Products may be shared with others according to the account preferences associated with that particular account. Your profile may be visible to others in accordance with these settings. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you publicly disclose online.

### Non-personal information and/or anonymous data

We may use non-personal information and/or anonymous data collected from you or your use of the Products for site administration, analytics, advertising and promotional purposes. We may share such information with other entities for such purposes. We may also aggregate data to enable research or analysis so that we can better understand and serve you and others.

We may use analysis tools such as Google Analytics. These provide us with information about how our users use the Products.

## Control you have over our use

You may delete your account at any time – this will remove your account page from our Product(s). We do not guarantee the ability to delete all stored data.

If you would like us to delete/correct Personal Data, let us know and we will act on your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Your account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You have the responsibility of preventing unauthorized access to your account and personal data by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

## Sharing your data with third parties

We may share anonymous data with third parties to, for example, improve Legalese, the Products, and to enable data aggregation as described above.

Where necessary, we may share your Personal Data with our independent contractors, subcontractors, service providers, or affiliates (in each case, subject to confidentiality obligations).

We may also share Personal Data with interested parties in the event that we anticipate a change in control or the acquisition of all or part of our business or assets.

If Legalese is sold or makes a sale or transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your personal data to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction.

We may share your Personal Data at any time if required for legal reasons or in order to enforce our [Terms of Use](/terms) or this Privacy Policy.

## How we protect your data

We care a great deal about keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. This is why we implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your Personal Data on our systems. Any Personal Data collected by us is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of Legalese personnel who have special access rights to such systems.

**However, no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure.** It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please [contact us immediately](mailto:support@legalese.com).
