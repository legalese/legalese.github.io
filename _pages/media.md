## Company Overview

Marc Andreessen said, "software is eating the world"; at Legalese, we say *software is eating law*. Our solution to the broken-law problem is to resolve it at a fundamental level, using math, computer science, and logic.

At the core, we are an open-source complaw project working on the drafting of legal documents the way programmers develop software.

We start by creating and implementing **L4**, a domain-specific language (DSL) for *legal* that is specifically designed to capture the particularities of law, its semantics, deontics, and logic.
