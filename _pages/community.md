## Tech Support

Ping us at [support@legalese.com](mailto:support@legalese.com?subject=HELP!%20Tech%20support%20needed)

We're **really** sorry. We know how annoyed / frustrated / stressed out / disappointed you must be right now to have encountered bugs and problems with our platform. We can't promise we can fix it right away (we certainly hope we can), but we definitely promise to keep you in the loop.

Thank you for bearing with our teething problems, we promise to make it worth your while.

Are you sure? It is 92% unglamorous work (e.g. spam moderation, reimbursement review, writing documentation, competency building, and a lot of reading) and we *generally* require several months of probation (code contributions, thought sharing, reading, peer review and assessment) before you can be considered a full member of the project. (That said, we're quite against unpaid internships. Our interns earn their place, and we compensate them for it.)

Still up for it? We like that. You might want to read [our thoughts on how we work](https://github.com/legalese/legalese.github.io/blob/master/doc/company.org) and read our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) to self-assess whether you're a good fit.

**Web developers, we want you** (if you know this [carp](https://github.com/legalese/legalese.github.io/blob/master/doc/company.org#2-roadmap-and-where-we-are-now) 🐟).
