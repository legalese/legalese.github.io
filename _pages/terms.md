## Hello! We are so chuffed to have you with us.

These Terms (as defined in detail below) describe your rights and responsibilities when using such of our website, web applications, platform, services, community / developer resources, and products as provided at [legalese.com](https://legalese.com) (each a "**Product**", and collectively, the "**Products**").

The Products are provided by Legalese Pte. Ltd. (also referred to as "**Legalese**", "**we**", "**our**" or "**us**"), a private limited company incorporated in Singapore with the unique entity number 201527692R. As a company and as a project, we try hard to be international, [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar), [remote-first](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/02/08/means-remote-first-company/), aspirationally [teal](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations), and [(softly) holacratic](https://www.holacracy.org/how-it-works/).

## First things first

### What 'These Terms' include

This document is to be read and interpreted together with, where applicable, our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and any additional terms, policies, and requirements that we may provide from time to time (all of which together with these Terms of Use, collectively referred to as these "**Terms**").

### These Terms form part of a binding contract

These Terms describe your rights and responsibilities, and govern your access and use of any or all of the Products, including any services or features we offer through it.

We know it can be a bit of a chore (as these things usually are), but please do read these Terms carefully as your agreement to be bound by these Terms is a condition for using or accessing any of the Products.

**In fact, by using or accessing any of the Products, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms.**

In other words, these Terms form a binding agreement between you and Legalese.

If you are not eligible to use or access the Products under these Terms, or if you do not agree to these Terms, then you do not have our permission to use or access the Products (or any part thereof).

### 'We' may include the extended team

We may leverage our employees, contributors, third party contractors, and such of those of our corporate affiliates (all of whom together, the "**Extended Team**") in exercising our rights and performing our obligations, whether directly or indirectly, in respect of the Products.

### Who 'you' are

You are the individual using and/or accessing the Products.

**If you're a representative**: You are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of whomever (whether individual, company, organisation, or entity) you are accessing or using the Products for. As such, please make sure that you have the necessary authority to enter into and agree to these Terms on such behalf before proceeding.

**Corporate email domain**: If you are signed up for an account on the Products using a corporate email domain, "**you**" means that entity owning that corporate email domain used to sign up for an account.

## Using the Products

Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Legalese grants you a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable permission to access and/or use the Products for your personal, internal use during the Term at the level of service for which you have paid all applicable fees.

You must ensure that you and anyone you give access to and/or authorise to use the Products in your account ("**Authorised Users**") fully comply with these Terms.

### We are not lawyers, legal, investment, accounting, tax, or financial advisors

**Legalese is a technology company**. We are not a law firm, are not engaged in a legal practice, and do not perform the services of a law firm or a solicitor. Accordingly, we do not give legal advice and cannot represent you. The Products are not intended (and shall not be used) as a substitute for legal, accounting, tax, investment, or other professional advice or services.

We aim to provide information and access to industry standards, received industry advice, open-source, third party and proprietary documents and tutorials, templated forms, analytics and data, team administration and networking functionality, cap table modelling, value-added document-related services, and additional features to assist with the completion of tasks and workflows relating to you, your company and/or its administration.

You agree that you are solely responsible for the appropriate use of any documents, instructions, tutorials or data downloaded, obtained from, or otherwise sourced in whole or in part from us or the Products. In particular you agree that:

- There is no solicitor–client relationship between you and Legalese, or any party who provided the templates.
- Legalese is not providing legal, financial, accounting, tax, investment or any other professional advice.
- The documents available via the Products may not fit your specific circumstances.
- Legalese cannot and does not provide any assurance or guarantee that any documents provided via the Products are suitable, sufficient, correct, or appropriate for the use to which you put them.
- Legalese is excluded from all legal responsibility and/or costs for reliance placed by anyone on the Products, or any information, documents, or logic obtained therefrom.

### General rules

- The Products are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 18.
- You and your Authorised Users must follow any policies made available to you within or via the Products.
- You and your Authorised Users must not misuse our Products.
- You and your Authorised Users must not use our Products where it is prohibited by laws applicable (whether to you or us).
- You and your Authorised Users must not use the Products in a way that infringes anyone's rights.
- Using the Products does not give you or your Authorised Users any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Products or any content or features accessed therein.
- You will also keep your billing and contact information current at all times by notifying Legalese of any changes.

### Non-Legalese Stuff You May Encounter

Our Products may from time to time include platforms that third parties may use to develop applications and software that complement the use of the Product(s), or content sourced from third parties that we have no legal relationship with or have no control over ("**Non-Legalese Stuff**"). Non-Legalese Stuff are not the Products, and we do not warrant or support them.

### Beta Products

Occasionally, we may release Product(s) and features on a alpha, beta, seed, and other pre-release basis, and related documentation, materials, and information (collectively, the "**Beta Products**").

Beta Products will be identified as "beta" or "pre-release", or with words or phrases importing similar meanings.

Beta Products are not ready for prime time, and any warranties or contractual commitments that we may make for other Products do not apply. Beta Products are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

## Modifying Products

We are constantly changing and improving. We may add or remove functionalities, features, or even entire Product(s) altogether. We may also stop providing Products to you, or add or create new limits to our Product(s) at any time. We also reserve the right to charge for any of our Product(s), features, or functionalities at any time.

## Send us feedback

We welcome feedback. When you send us feedback or suggestions regarding us or any of the Products, there is a chance that we will use it. Please note that if you send us any feedback or suggestions, they will likely not be kept confidential. Along with any feedback or suggestions, you also grant us an unlimited, unrestricted, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, transferable, royalty-free right to use and exploit any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to you.

## User Data

You or your Authorised Users may upload, submit, store, send or receive content or information (including any confidential company or personal data) as part of your use and/or access of the Products ("**User Data**") and you may exclusively provide us with instructions on what to do with it.

### Your responsibilities

It is your responsibility to (a) inform all Authorised Users of your own policies and practices, and applicable laws and/or regulations that are relevant to their use of the Products; and (b) obtain all rights, permissions, or consents from Authorised Users or such other persons that are necessary to grant the rights and licenses under these Terms.

### How we treat User Data

Your User Data is uploaded and downloaded over a secure connection, your credentials are encrypted and hashed. We don't store (or even know) your password. Your User Data is stored securely, and only people you've given express account access to can access your User Data.

For more information about how we treat your User Data, and also other kinds of data we collect, read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

### Protecting User Data

The protection of User Data is a top priority for us. We will strive to maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards at a level not materially less protective than our own Security Policy.

However, ultimately, you (not us) bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of User Data when in your or your representatives' or agents' possession or control.

## Ownership of information & proprietary rights

### General rule

You are prohibited from using proprietary content from or in the Products for purposes other than that which they have been provided for under the Products, unless you have obtained the requisite permission from its owner.

### What's yours is yours

As between us on one hand, and you and your Authorised Users on the other, you will retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in User Data, and all confidentiality rights in confidential data.

### What's others' is theirs

The Products may from time to time display content that is not ours. Such content remains their rightful owners'.

### What's ours is ours

Using the Products does not give you ownership or any proprietary or intellectual property rights in the Products or the content that you access.

### Other restrictions

These Terms also do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in the Products. You are also prohibited from removing, obscuring, or altering any notices or disclaimers displayed in or along with the Products.

As an open source company, open source software is even more important to us. Some software used in our products may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you.

## Privacy & copyright protection

Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) explains how we treat information, your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Products. By using the Products, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect you to do the same.

If you have an intellectual-property rights related complaint about material posted on or distributed through the Products, please write to us at [support@legalese.com](mailto:support@legalese.com).

## Your purchasing decisions

We may from time to time share information about our future products, plans, features, and functionalities ("**Possible Futures**") because we relish the transparency and openness. However, please do not rely on our public statements about any Possible Futures when making a commitment or purchase with us. Should you decide to buy the Products or pay for any of them, that decision should be based on the functionalities or features that we have made available today and not on any expectation of delivery of any Possible Futures.

## Your payment obligations (if any)

### Payment terms

Fees and payment obligations for any of the Products may be set out to you in the user interface, as appropriate. Payment obligations are non-cancellable and, except as expressly stated by us in written terms, fees paid are non-refundable.

If we agree to invoice you by email, full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date.

### Credits

Any credits that may accrue to your account will expire following the expiration date as applicable, will have no currency or exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable.

## Our responsibilities

### Providing the Products

You're not the only one with responsibilities; we have some, too. We will, subject to these Terms, use our best efforts to make the Product(s) available.
