      <h4>(or how we got the idea to represent contracts as code)</h4>
      <p>Once upon a time, a programmer received an investment contract containing the following text:</p>
      <div id="investment-contract">
	<p>1.2.1 If the investment for the purpose of the Series B
	  Funding is valued at not more than $32.5 Million, then the
	  investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert the
	  Note into Shares at a fixed valuation of $27.5
	  million.</p>
	<p>1.2.2 If the investment for the purpose of the Series B
	  Funding is valued at less than $40 million but not below
	  $32.5 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be
	  entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount
	  over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance,
	  if the series B Funding is at a valuation of $35 million,
	  then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to
	  convert at a valuation of 35M less 15% discount);</p>
	<p>1.2.3 If the investment for the purpose of the Series B
	  Funding is valued at not less than $40 million but less
	  than $47.06 million, investors in the Convertible Note
	  will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15%
	  discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for
	  instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of
	  $47.06 million, then the investors in the Note shall be
	  entitled to convert at a pre-money valuation of 40M
	  i.e. $47.06 million less 15% discount);</p>
	<p>1.2.4 If the investment for the purpose of the Series B
	  Funding is valued at not less than $47.06 million but less
	  than $80 million, investors in the Convertible Note will
	  be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed
	  pre-money valuation of $40 million;</p>
	<p>1.2.5 If the investment for the purpose of the Series B
	  Funding is valued at not less than $80M but less than
	  $100M, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled
	  to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money
	  valuation of $45M; and</p>
	<p>1.2.6 If the investment for the purpose of the Series B
	  Funding is valued at not less than $100 million, investors
	  in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the
	  Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of $50
	  million.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Ten minutes and a strong cup of tea later, the notes in the margin read:</p>
      <pre>
	// why wasn't this just if( seriesB < 32.5 ) { conversion = 27.5 }
					      else if( seriesB < 40 ) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 } else if(
								 seriesB < 47.06 ) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 } // then why the
									   above line?  else if( seriesB < 80 ) { conversion = 40 } else if(
													   seriesB < 100 ) { conversion = 45 } else { conversion = 50 }
														     </pre>

	  engineer<span>Andreessen co-authored Mosaic (the first widely used web
	    browser) and co-founded Netscape)</span></a>says “<em>eats</em>” he
	probably had something very specific in mind: &nbsp;the
	“Turing’ification” of an industry is something that only a computer
	scientist can properly understand. In Twitter conversation with us, in
	2014, he mentioned Judicata and LegalZoom – then said “we’re looking
	for a good one.” What does that mean?  Find-a-lawyer marketplaces,
	download-a-template sites, and e-discovery search engines may be
	nibbling at the edges of the traditional legal profession, but they
	aren’t eating it, not the way Uber is eating the taxi industry, or the
	way Netflix is eating TV.  <b>Today’s document automation software is
	  mostly a more full-featured version of Microsoft Word</b>. Although
	Legalese sees its roots in document automation, we have our sights set
	higher and deeper: &nbsp;on deep-tech, computer-science-driven
	software that will transform the legal industry (not just the legal
	profession), serving not just lawyers but end users directly as
	well.</p>

      <p>Gotta respect the prior art; there's <em>a lot</em> of
        it. In fact, legal informatics goes back at
        least <a class="a-link" href="#informatics-content">70
          years</a>.</p><br>

      <h2 class="lower-nav-el" id="L4">L4:&nbsp; a domain-specific
	language (DSL) for law</h2>

      <p>When we borrow Andreessen's adage and say "<em>software
	  is eating law</em>", we mean software eating law in a rather
	specific way:&nbsp; it gets <a class="a-link"
				       href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/turingd/"
				       target="_blank">Turing’d</a>, by way of a domain-specific
	language. (Lawyers, don’t worry; <a class="a-link"
					    href="http://hodgen.com/questions-are-harder-than-answers/"
					    target="_blank">you’ll keep your
	  jobs</a>, <em>sorta</em>)</p>

      <p>A domain-specific <b>programming</b> language (DSL) for
	legal means a language that is <b>designed to capture legal
	  semantics and logic</b>; a deep-tech computer science
	approach to law. The DSL does for the <a class="a-link"
						 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_%CE%BC-calculus"
						 target="_blank">modal calculus</a> what <a class="a-link"
											    href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming"
											    target="_blank">functional languages</a> do for
	the <a class="a-link"
	       href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus"
	       target="_blank">lambda calculus</a>.<br>  The one we're
	designing and implementing is called, <b>L4</b>.</p>

      <p>Simply put, a DSL means that all legal (and quasi-legal)
	documents and laws will have a <b>common denominator for
	  entire suites of future functionality</b>. The history of
	computer science informs the future of legal: &nbsp;we can
	translate entire families of concepts, such as compilation,
	dependency management, multi-lingual code, linters, code
	libraries, fuzz testing, unit & integration testing, and
	even agile development and opensource software communities
	of practice. Accompanied by static analysers capable of
	formal verification, a DSL will enable us to prove, to the
	extent mathematically possible, that the contracts written
	in the language are correct, consistent, and compliant with
	legislative constraints.</p>

      <p>The idea of building a DSL for an entire domain is not new; &nbsp;
	companies like Adobe, Intuit, Autodesk, Cadence &ndash;
	category-owners of their respective fields all started with their own
	domain specific languages / standards.  As Frederik Pohl might put
	it, <em>a good futurist predicts the car; a great futurist predicts
	  the traffic jam.</em> If the car is a formal language for contracts
	and agreements (maybe even legislation), then a taxi service might be
	smart contracts integrated with cryptocurrencies and wholly automated
	business processes, exposed through legally binding APIs. The traffic
	jam? Maybe that’s a DDOS in the form of micro-contract spam, a welter
	of frivolous lawsuits, or a zero-day exploit of an error enshrined in
	some old piece of paperwork that didn’t get patched with the latest
	service pack.</p>

      <p>The battery of tools which computer scientists and
	programmers currently have at their disposal (of which
	lawyers don’t even have an inkling) can be applied to the
	field of legal.  Legalese asserts what <a class="a-link"
						  href="https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrows-Lawyers-Introduction-Your-Future/dp/019966806X/"
						  target="_blank">tomorrow's lawyers</a> do will look a lot
	like what today's programmers do: &nbsp;drawing on
	opensource libraries, they will configure code for clients
	that compiles to readable contracts &ndash; maybe English,
	maybe Ethereum/Hyperledger. From that future, we will look
	back on today's lawyers, drafting agreements in Microsoft
	Word and checking references by hand, as impossibly quaint,
	like hand embroidery.</p>
