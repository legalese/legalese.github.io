	      You know, when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices," Finkle-McGraw said. "It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of climate, you are not allowed to criticise others &mdash; after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?"<br>
...<br>
	      "Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done. In this case, you are not making any judgment whatsoever as to the correctness of his views or the morality of his behaviour &mdash; you are merely pointing out that he has said one thing and done another. Virtually all political discouse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy."<br>
	      ...<br>
	      "We take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy," Finkle-McGraw continued. "In the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite was someone who espoused high moral views as part of a planned campaign of deception &mdash; he never held these beliefs sincerely and routinely violated them in privacy. Of course, most hypocrites are not like that. Most of the time it's a spirit-is-willing, flesh-is-weak sort of thing."<br><br>

	      "That we occassionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code." "Of course not," Finkle-McGraw said. "It's perfectly obvious, really. No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct. Really, the difficulties involved &mdash; the missteps we make along the way &mdash; are what make it interesting. The internal, and external, struggle between our base impulses and the rigorous demands of our own moral system is quintessentially human. It is how we conduct ourselves in that struggle that determines how we may in time be judged by a higher power." All three men were quiet for a few moments, chewing mouthfuls of beer or smoke, pondering the matter.

	  <h2>Zero Tolerance of Harrassment</h2>
	  <p>We are committed to being a harrassment-free organisation

	  contributors, staff, customers, volunteers, sponsors,
	  partners, members of the public &mdash;
	  with <a class="a-link"

	  <p>Harrassment is not tolerated. Harrassment includes (but
	    is not limited to):<br>
	    <ul>
	      <li>verbal language that reinforces
	  social structures of domination related to gender identity
	  and expression, marital status, body size, sexual

	      <li>deliberate intimidation; </li>

	      <li>harrassing photography or recording;
	      <li>sustained disruption or hijacking of discussions and/or events;</li>
	      <li>non-adherance to the boundaries established or

	      <li>incitement of violence towards any individual,
	      including encouraging a person to self-harm;</li>
	      <li>continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease;</li>
	      <li>physical contact (including simulated physical
	      contact, for example, textual descriptions like
	      *backrub*) or sexual attention, without consent or after
	      a request to stop; and</li>

	 <h3>Reporting harrassment</h3>
	  <p>We take harrassment very seriously. Please report any kind of harrassment or suspicions of harrassment to us at <a class="a-link" href="mailto:collective@legalese.com?subject=Reporting Harrassment">collective@legalese.com</a> or to Alexis personally at <a class="a-link" href="mailto:alexis@legalese.com?subject=Reporting Harrassment">alexis@legalese.com</a>.</p>

	  <h3>Violations</h3>
	  <p>Anyone who is found to be in violation may be handled in one or more of these methods:<br>
	    <ul><li>warning (public or otherwise);</li>
	      <li>expulsion; </li>
	      <li>contacting of the police; and</li>
	      <li>actions stronger than a warning that may also be taken at the discretion of two or more board members.</li></ul></p>

	  <p>Malicious false reporting will also be treated harshly. Personal disputes should be handled privately, unless actual harrassment occurs.</p>

	  <p>We reserve the right to remove anyone at any time for any reason.</p>
