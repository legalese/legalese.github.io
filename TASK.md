I'm using PagesCMS to manage this next.js app for the Legalese website.

Clone another copy of the legalese.github.io project into an adjacent folder with the "static" branch. There is a bunch of content in there in a Jekyll website for github pages that shall be the source of everything we're building today. Just ignore the solutions page and price list as all of this is old and outdated.

Your task:

1. Study how the current CMS implementation is setup in this current repo to understand how it works.

2. Prepare this current repo (it's on "main" branch) by clearing all the current example content. 

3. Using the content from the "static" branch clone, create a long-scroll homepage for Legalese that has new intro section for what we do with rules automation and L4 (use filler content for now or research L4 and legalese online) , a short section about any partners/logos we've worked with and past projects to add credibility, a resource section with links to blog posts (more on those below) and finally an about us section listing the team members and last the contact and engagement section.

4. Create subpages for Terms, Privacy. Press/Media, Code-of-Conduct.

5. Convert all other content (again, ignore solutions page) to blog posts instead of fixed pages.

The content of all these pages should be manageable via PagesCMS.
