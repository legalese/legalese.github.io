# Why are you developing a language? Can’t you just write apps?

In computer science, languages are foundational. If you want differentiated applications, you need a differentiated stack beneath those applications. At the bottom of the stack you will usually find some sort of programming language.

* What was Adobe’s first product? Not Photoshop. It was PostScript: a Turing-complete language for printing. It laid the groundwork for future technologies, like PDF and fonts, and future applications, like Illustrator.
* What was Microsoft’s first product? Not Windows. It was BASIC: a Turing-complete consumer-grade language for home programmers, and the first [high-level programming language](https://backchannel.com/a-spreadsheet-way-of-knowledge-8de60af7146e#.o37cgoaj1) available for the Altair 8800 microcomputer.
* What was Oracle’s first product? An SQL RDBMS: a Turing-complete language (if you add PL/SQL) for data management, now an essential part of every programmer’s toolkit.
* What was Netscape’s first product? A web browser that displayed HTML – Hypertext Markup Language.  What was its second product? Javascript: a Turing-complete language that brought interactivity to the web, now one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
* What do telephone switches and Whatsapp have in common? They run on Erlang/OTP: a Turing-complete functional language for high-availability telecommunications protocols. Every phone call you make, every Whatsapp message you send, runs on Erlang.

* [Spreadsheets](https://backchannel.com/a-spreadsheet-way-of-knowledge-8de60af7146e#.zepgrj4d4) are sort of a programming language. VisiCalc (Apple II), Lotus 1-2-3 (DOS), Excel (Windows): Turing-complete consumer-grade applications for business users to crunch numbers, and the foundation for modern enterprise.

To be pedantic, languages are not quite at the bottom of the stack. There is a sub-basement: mathematics. They call this the [Curry–Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence).

So it is fair to say: if software is eating the world, where does its appetite come from? From math.

This needs to be well-answered.

Highpoints:
* Much fewer runtime bugs!
    * much better compile-time checking!
* compositionality!
* Much fewer logic bugs!
    * formal verification!
    * better testing!
