  <div marked="data.body" class="ng-isolate-scope"><p>Hello future power-users!  We are developing the L4 language that can handle simple contracts such as our <a href="../announcements/food-eating-contract">A food eating contract</a>.  Once that's done, we'd love to see some of things you do with it.  Eventually we'll be asking you to learn L4, try translating common contracts into it, to see what the compiler produces.</p>

* For knowing what kind output is needed for contract drafting, read [A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting](http://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/)

* To see what the state-of-the-art for math/logic geeks have so far in representing contracts, read the first three chapters of this PhD thesis, [Contract Formalisation and Modular Implementation of Domain-Specific Languages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU/view)

* Most of you are excited about the exciting future of legal programming, but a few of you are scared.   If you don't want to program, will you still be able to practice law?  The short answer is yes, and the book [Tomorrow's Lawyers](https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrows-Lawyers-Introduction-Your-Future/dp/019966806X) shows how to position yourselves.

* We're completely open with our game plan.  It's [available here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link v1.0/page/future.md %}).

* Here's some [design fiction for the world we imagine the future will be](https://github.com/legalese/legalese.com/blob/dbddd095a637eba65edd6217a80c33dc5671ab4f/doc/designfiction.org).
